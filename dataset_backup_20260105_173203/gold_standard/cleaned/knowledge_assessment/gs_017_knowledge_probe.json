Can you briefly describe the vulnerability and its impact?\n5. What was the recommended fix?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific audit finding, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific audit finding.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about from your training data.",
