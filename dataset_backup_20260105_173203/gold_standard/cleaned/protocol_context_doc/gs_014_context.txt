PROTOCOL CONTEXT: Aragon - LockManager Base

PROTOCOL TYPE: Token Locking / Governance Infrastructure

OVERVIEW:
LockManagerBase provides the core logic for the Aragon Lock-to-Vote system. It tracks which proposals each user has voted on, manages the relationship between locked tokens and active votes, and ensures tokens cannot be unlocked while votes are still active.

BUSINESS MODEL:
- Tracks user participation in active proposals
- Manages the lifecycle of locked tokens in relation to voting
- Ensures users cannot withdraw tokens while they have active votes
- Cleans up tracking when proposals end (pass, fail, or expire)
- Coordinates between the token locking mechanism and the voting plugin
