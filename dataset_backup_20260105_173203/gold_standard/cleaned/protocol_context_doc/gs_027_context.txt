PROTOCOL CONTEXT: Mantle - Staking Unstake Requests (mETH)

PROTOCOL TYPE: Liquid Staking / Withdrawal Queue

OVERVIEW:
The Mantle Staking contract manages unstake requests where users can exchange mETH back for ETH. Due to Ethereum's validator exit delays, unstaking is a two-step process: users first request unstaking (locking mETH and reserving ETH), then claim after processing.

BUSINESS MODEL:
- Users request unstaking by specifying mETH amount to redeem
- The exchange rate is fixed at request time to determine ETH owed
- mETH is locked but not immediately burned (burned on claim)
- Protocol allocates ETH to fulfill pending requests
- Users claim their ETH after the unstake request is processed
