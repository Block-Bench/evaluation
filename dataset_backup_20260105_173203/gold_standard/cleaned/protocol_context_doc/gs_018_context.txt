PROTOCOL CONTEXT: Gearbox - Midas Redemption Gateway

PROTOCOL TYPE: DeFi Integration / Credit Account Gateway

OVERVIEW:
MidasRedemptionVaultGateway integrates Gearbox credit accounts with Midas vault redemptions. Midas vaults require a request-then-claim workflow where users request redemption, wait for admin approval, then claim their tokens. This gateway manages the asynchronous redemption process on behalf of credit accounts.

BUSINESS MODEL:
- Enables Gearbox credit accounts to interact with Midas vaults
- Manages the asynchronous redemption request lifecycle
- Tracks pending redemptions for each credit account
- Handles the conversion between mTokens (Midas vault shares) and underlying tokens
- Integrates with phantom tokens to represent pending redemption value
