PROTOCOL CONTEXT: Sequence - BaseAuth Sapient Signer

PROTOCOL TYPE: Smart Contract Wallet / Nested Wallets

OVERVIEW:
Sequence wallets support "sapient signers" - other smart contracts (including other Sequence wallets) that can act as signers. The BaseAuth module handles recovery and validation of signatures from these smart contract signers, enabling nested wallet configurations.

BUSINESS MODEL:
- Wallets can use other smart contracts as authorized signers
- Sapient signers implement the ISapient interface for signature validation
- The wallet recovers the signer's image hash to verify authorization
- Enables complex multi-party setups where organizations control wallets
- Supports Merkle tree-based signer configurations for efficient validation
