PROTOCOL CONTEXT: Hybra Finance - VoterV3

PROTOCOL TYPE: Gauge Voting / ve(3,3) Governance

OVERVIEW:
VoterV3 is the core voting contract in a ve(3,3) tokenomics system. It allows veNFT holders to allocate their voting power across liquidity pools, determining how protocol emissions are distributed. Voting power decays over time as locks approach expiration.

BUSINESS MODEL:
- veNFT holders vote on which liquidity pools receive protocol emissions
- Voting power is proportional to locked token amount and remaining lock duration
- Votes determine the share of emissions each gauge receives
- Users can update votes each epoch to reflect their preferences
- The poke mechanism allows refreshing vote weights to reflect decayed voting power
