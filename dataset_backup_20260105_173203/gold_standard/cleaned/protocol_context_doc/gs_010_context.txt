PROTOCOL CONTEXT: Aragon - Lock-to-Vote Plugin

PROTOCOL TYPE: DAO Governance / Voting Plugin

OVERVIEW:
Lock-to-Vote is an Aragon DAO plugin that enables token-weighted governance where users must lock tokens to participate in voting. It includes a minimum voting power requirement to create proposals, preventing spam while ensuring meaningful participation.

BUSINESS MODEL:
- Token holders lock tokens in a LockManager to gain voting power
- A minimum voting power threshold is required to create proposals
- Users vote on proposals using their locked token weight
- Proposals can be configured for early execution if sufficient support is reached
- Tokens remain locked until the user explicitly unlocks them
