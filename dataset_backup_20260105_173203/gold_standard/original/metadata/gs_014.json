But in _withdrawActiveVotingPower() at line 225, it was being used as an 'isProposalStillOpen()' function, forgetting that it will also be false when the proposal hasn't started yet.

Line 226: knownProposalIds.remove(_proposalId) - proposal removed from tracking.\n6. Proposal starts a week later, user votes.\n7. User calls unlock() again - vote isn't cleared because proposal isn't tracked.\n8. User withdraws tokens while still having active votes.",
