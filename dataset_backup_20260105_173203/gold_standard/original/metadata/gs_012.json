  "description": "If the erc20Token configured within LockManagerERC20 is a token that does not revert due to insufficient approved funds, the msg.sender can inflate their lockedBalances[msg.sender] by an arbitrary _amount without actually sending any token.

Some ERC20 tokens like BAT, HT, cUSDC, ZRX do not revert when a transfer fails but instead return false.",
