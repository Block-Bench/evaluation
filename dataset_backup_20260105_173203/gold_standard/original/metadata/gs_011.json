  "description": "If the token used by the LockManager can be flashloaned (or flashminted) and a proposal is created with the voting mode EarlyExecution, anyone could be able to 'early execute' it by flashloaning tokens, locking them, casting a YES vote to trigger early execution, unlocking tokens, and repaying the flashloan - all in one transaction. The vulnerable code is in LockToVotePlugin.vote() at lines 205-207 which calls _attemptEarlyExecution() when VotingMode.EarlyExecution is set.",

  "fix_description": "Avoid allowing the early execution in the very same block that the vote has been made. This would require tracking the 'success' of a proposal in a separate flag, stored in the proposal struct. Alternatively, remove the EarlyExecution voting mode entirely.",

The vote() function at lines 205-207 calls _attemptEarlyExecution() which can execute the proposal in the same transaction as the vote. An attacker can flashloan tokens, lock them, vote YES to trigger early execution, then unlock and repay - all atomically.",
