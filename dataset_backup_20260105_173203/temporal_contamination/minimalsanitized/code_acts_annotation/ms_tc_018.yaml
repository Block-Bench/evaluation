          address _quoteToken,
          uint256 _lpFeeRate
      ) external {
    security_function: "ROOT_CAUSE"
    rationale: "ROOT_CAUSE - init function has no require(!isInitialized) guard. Anyone can call init() multiple times to reinitialize the pool and become the new maintainer."

  - id: "CA2"
    type: "STATE_MOD"
    lines: [37, 38, 39, 40]
    code: |
      maintainer = _maintainer;
      baseToken = _baseToken;
      quoteToken = _quoteToken;
      lpFeeRate = _lpFeeRate;
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "State overwrites during init. These are consequences of calling unguarded init() - the root cause is the missing guard (CA1)."

  - id: "CA3"
    type: "DECLARATION"
    lines: [25]
    code: "bool public isInitialized;"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "isInitialized flag declaration. Represents a failed mitigation attempt - the flag exists but is not checked in init()."

  - id: "CA4"
    type: "STATE_MOD"
    lines: [43]
    code: "isInitialized = true;"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Sets isInitialized but doesn't prevent reinitialization since init() doesn't check this flag. Ineffective safeguard."

  - id: "CA5"
    type: "INPUT_VAL"
    lines: [52]
    code: 'require(isInitialized, "Not initialized");'
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Correct initialization check in addLiquidity. Shows isInitialized is used elsewhere but not in init()."

  - id: "CA6"
    type: "INPUT_VAL"
    lines: [69]
    code: 'require(isInitialized, "Not initialized");'
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Correct initialization check in swap. Shows intended pattern."

  - id: "CA7"

    lines: [54, 55]
    code: |
      IERC20(baseToken).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), baseAmount);
      IERC20(quoteToken).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), quoteAmount);
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Token transfers in addLiquidity. Correctly implemented."

  - id: "CA8"
    type: "STATE_MOD"
    lines: [57, 58]
    code: |
      baseBalance += baseAmount;
      quoteBalance += quoteAmount;
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Balance updates in addLiquidity."

  - id: "CA9"

    code: |

              (fromToken == quoteToken && toToken == baseToken),
          "Invalid token pair"
      );
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Token pair validation in swap. Correctly implemented."

  - id: "CA10"
    type: "COMPUTATION"
    lines: [80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88]

          quoteBalance += fromAmount;
          baseBalance -= toAmount;
      }
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Swap amount calculation using constant product formula."

  - id: "CA11"
    type: "COMPUTATION"
    lines: [91, 92]
    code: |
      uint256 fee = (toAmount * lpFeeRate) / 10000;
      toAmount -= fee;
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Fee calculation. This is impact amplification - any value-bearing role is exploitable once maintainer is hijacked."

  - id: "CA12"
    type: "EXT_CALL"
    lines: [95, 98]
    code: |
      IERC20(toToken).transfer(msg.sender, toAmount);
      IERC20(toToken).transfer(maintainer, fee);
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Token transfers including fee to maintainer. Post-exploit consequence - defines where value flows after compromise."

  - id: "CA13"
    type: "ACCESS_CTRL"
    lines: [107]
    code: 'require(msg.sender == maintainer, "Only maintainer");'
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Maintainer check in claimFees. Correct access control - bypassed after reinitialization as a consequence."

  - id: "CA14"
    type: "CTRL_FLOW"
    lines: [115, 116, 117, 118, 120, 121, 122, 123]

          IERC20(quoteToken).transfer(maintainer, excess);
      }
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Fee claim logic. Post-exploit consequence - the exploit is complete at maintainer overwrite."

  - id: "CA15"
    type: "EVENT_EMIT"
    lines: [45]
    code: "emit Initialized(_maintainer, _baseToken, _quoteToken);"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Event emission in init. No security impact."

  - id: "CA16"
    type: "CTRL_FLOW"
