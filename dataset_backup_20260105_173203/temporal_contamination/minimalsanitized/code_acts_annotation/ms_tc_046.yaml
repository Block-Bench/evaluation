      }
    security_function: "ROOT_CAUSE"
    rationale: "ROOT_CAUSE - Admin can arbitrarily change ANY user's lock recipient without user consent. Rogue developer redirects all withdrawals to attacker wallet."

    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Impact execution path. Post-compromise function that transfers using already-manipulated recipient. Without CA1, this is benign."

          emit ConfigUpdated(oldConfig, _configStorage);
      }
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Config storage setter. Latent admin capability not exercised in the actual attack - attacker used setLockRecipient (CA1) directly."

    code: |
      function transferAdmin(address newAdmin) external onlyAdmin {
          admin = newAdmin;
      }
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Admin transfer function. Latent capability not required for exploitation - rogue developer already had admin access."
