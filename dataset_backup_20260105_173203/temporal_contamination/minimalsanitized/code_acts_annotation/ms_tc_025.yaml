  - id: "CA1"
    type: "DECLARATION"
    lines: [11, 12, 13]
    code: |
      mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf;
      uint256 public totalSupply;
      uint256 public feePercent = 10; // 10% burn on transfer
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "DeflatToken state declarations. The token works correctly - the vault's failure to account for fees is the issue."

  - id: "CA2"
    type: "COMPUTATION"
    lines: [16, 17]
    code: |
      uint256 fee = (amount * feePercent) / 100;
      uint256 amountAfterFee = amount - fee;
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Fee calculation in DeflatToken. Correctly implemented - this is the token's expected behavior."

  - id: "CA3"
    type: "STATE_MOD"
    lines: [19, 20, 21]
    code: |
      balanceOf[msg.sender] -= amount;
      balanceOf[to] += amountAfterFee;
      totalSupply -= fee; // Burn fee
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Token transfer with fee deduction. Correctly implemented in DeflatToken."

  - id: "CA4"
    type: "CTRL_FLOW"
    lines: [23, 24]
    code: |
      return true;
      }
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Transfer return. Correctly implemented."

  - id: "CA5"
    type: "COMPUTATION"
    lines: [27, 28]
    code: |
      uint256 fee = (amount * feePercent) / 100;
      uint256 amountAfterFee = amount - fee;
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Fee calculation in transferFrom. Correctly implemented."

  - id: "CA6"
    type: "STATE_MOD"
    lines: [30, 31, 32]
    code: |
      balanceOf[from] -= amount;
      balanceOf[to] += amountAfterFee;
      totalSupply -= fee;
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "TransferFrom state updates in DeflatToken. Correctly implemented."

  - id: "CA7"
    type: "DECLARATION"
    lines: [39, 40]
    code: |
      address public token;
      mapping(address => uint256) public deposits;
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Vault storage declarations. The declarations themselves don't enable the exploit."

  - id: "CA8"
    type: "INITIALIZATION"
    lines: [42, 43, 44]
    code: |
      constructor(address _token) {
          token = _token;
      }
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Constructor sets token. Correctly implemented."

  - id: "CA9"
    type: "EXT_CALL"
    lines: [48]
    code: "IERC20(token).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Token transfer call. The call is correct - the bug is that CA10 doesn't verify actual received amount."

  - id: "CA10"
    type: "STATE_MOD"
    lines: [50]
    code: "deposits[msg.sender] += amount;"
    security_function: "ROOT_CAUSE"
    rationale: "ROOT_CAUSE - Credits full 'amount' to user but vault only received 90%. User can withdraw full amount, draining other users' funds. Should check actual balance change: balBefore/balAfter."

  - id: "CA11"
    type: "INPUT_VAL"
    lines: [55]
    code: 'require(deposits[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient");'
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Withdrawal check. Passes because full amount was credited."

  - id: "CA12"
    type: "STATE_MOD"
    lines: [57]
    code: "deposits[msg.sender] -= amount;"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Deposit decrement on withdrawal."

  - id: "CA13"
    type: "EXT_CALL"
    lines: [60]
    code: "IERC20(token).transfer(msg.sender, amount);"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Transfer on withdrawal. Sends full credited amount (more than received)."
