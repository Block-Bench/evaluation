  # SECURITY-RELEVANT CODE ACTS (detailed)
  # ============================================

  - id: "CA1"
    type: "INPUT_VAL"
    lines: [55, 56, 57, 58, 59]
    code: |
      require(v.length >= REQUIRED_SIGNATURES, "Insufficient signatures");
      require(
          v.length == r.length && r.length == s.length,
          "Signature length mismatch"
      );
    security_function: "ROOT_CAUSE"
    rationale: "ROOT_CAUSE - Only validates signature COUNT (>=5) and array length consistency. Missing ecrecover to verify signatures are from authorized validators. Attacker with compromised keys can forge valid-looking signatures."

  - id: "CA2"
    type: "DECLARATION"
    lines: [12, 13]
    code: |
      uint256 public constant REQUIRED_SIGNATURES = 5;
      uint256 public constant TOTAL_VALIDATORS = 7;
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Threshold configuration. The exploit works regardless of threshold - even 7-of-7 would be exploitable since signer identity is never verified."

  - id: "CA3"
    type: "DECLARATION"
    lines: [15, 16]
    code: |
      mapping(address => bool) public validators;
      address[] public validatorList;
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Validator storage (unused). The fact that this is unused doesn't enable the exploit - it's CA1's failure to use ecrecover that's the issue."

  - id: "CA4"
    type: "INPUT_VAL"
    lines: [49, 50, 51, 52]
    code: |
      require(
          !processedTransactions[txHash],
          "Transaction already processed"
      );
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Replay protection. Correctly prevents double-processing."

  - id: "CA5"
    type: "COMPUTATION"
    lines: [46]
    code: "bytes32 txHash = bytes32s[1];"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Extract transaction hash from input."

  - id: "CA6"
    type: "COMPUTATION"
    lines: [65]
    code: "uint256 amount = uints[0];"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Extract amount from input."

  - id: "CA7"
    type: "STATE_MOD"
    lines: [68]
    code: "processedTransactions[txHash] = true;"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Mark transaction as processed for replay protection."

  - id: "CA8"
    type: "EXT_CALL"
    lines: [71]
    code: "IERC20(token).transfer(toAddr, amount);"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Token transfer to recipient. Correctly implemented."

  - id: "CA9"
    type: "CTRL_FLOW"
    lines: [73]
    code: "emit WithdrawalProcessed(txHash, token, toAddr, amount);"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Event emission for transparency."

  - id: "CA10"
    type: "STATE_MOD"
    lines: [80]
    code: "validators[validator] = true;"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Validator addition (simplified, missing access control)."
