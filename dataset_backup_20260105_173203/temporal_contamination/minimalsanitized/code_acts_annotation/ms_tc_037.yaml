    lines: [55]
    code: "uint256 uniBTCAmount = msg.value;"
    security_function: "ROOT_CAUSE"
    rationale: "ROOT_CAUSE - Assigns uniBTC amount equal to ETH sent without any conversion. Assumes 1 ETH = 1 BTC when actual ratio is ~20:1, allowing attacker to mint 20x more uniBTC than they should."

  - id: "CA2"
    type: "CTRL_FLOW"
    lines: [101]
    code: "return 1e18;"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Hardcoded rate in getExchangeRate(). Dead/unused logic - function is never called by mint() or redeem(). Vulnerability is in CA1's direct assignment."

  - id: "CA3"
    type: "INPUT_VAL"
    lines: [50]
    code: 'require(msg.value > 0, "No ETH sent");'
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Basic input validation."

    code: |
      totalETHDeposited += msg.value;

    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "State tracking updates."

    type: "EXT_CALL"
    lines: [72]
    code: "uniBTC.transfer(msg.sender, uniBTCAmount);"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Token transfer. Impact path that realizes the incorrectly calculated amount - vulnerability is in CA1."

  - id: "CA6"
    type: "INPUT_VAL"
    lines: [79, 80]
    code: |
      require(amount > 0, "No amount specified");
      require(uniBTC.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Redeem input validation."

    type: "EXT_CALL"
    lines: [84]
    code: "uniBTC.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Token transfer in redeem."

  - id: "CA8"
    type: "COMPUTATION"
    lines: [86]
    code: "uint256 ethAmount = amount;"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Redeem calculation. Mirror of same bug in CA1 but not required for profit - attacker uses external swap to exit."

  - id: "CA9"
    type: "INPUT_VAL"
    lines: [87]
    code: 'require(address(this).balance >= ethAmount, "Insufficient ETH");'
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "ETH balance check."

    type: "EXT_CALL"
    lines: [89]
    code: "payable(msg.sender).transfer(ethAmount);"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "ETH transfer to redeemer."
