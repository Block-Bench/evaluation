      function uniswapV3SwapCallback(
          int256 amount0Delta,
          int256 amount1Delta,
          bytes calldata data
      ) external payable {
    security_function: "ROOT_CAUSE"
    rationale: "ROOT_CAUSE - Callback function lacks msg.sender validation. Anyone can directly call this function with crafted parameters, bypassing the expected Uniswap pool caller check."

  - id: "CA2"
    type: "EXT_CALL"
    lines: [64, 65]
    code: |
      WETH.withdraw(amountToPay);
      payable(recipient).transfer(amountToPay);
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "WETH withdrawal and ETH transfer. Impact sink that realizes the exploit - vulnerability is the missing caller validation (CA1)."

  - id: "CA3"
    type: "EXT_CALL"
    lines: [67]
    code: "IERC20(tokenIn).transfer(recipient, amountToPay);"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Token transfer. Impact sink that realizes the exploit - vulnerability is the missing caller validation (CA1)."

          address recipient
      ) = abi.decode(data, (uint256, address, address, address));
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Calldata decoding. Only exploitable because CA1 allows unauthorized callers - the decode itself isn't the vulnerability."

    rationale: "Control flow for determining amount and token type."

    type: "INPUT_VAL"
    lines: [76]
    code: 'require(msg.sender == settlement, "Only settlement");'
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Access control on executeSettlement (correctly implemented, unlike callback)."
