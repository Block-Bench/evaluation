  - id: "CA1"
    type: "DECLARATION"
    lines: [30]
    code: "mapping(address => uint256) public depositedLP;"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "User LP deposit tracking. Not directly involved in vulnerability."

  - id: "CA2"
    type: "DECLARATION"
    lines: [31]
    code: "mapping(address => uint256) public earnedRewards;"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Reward tracking mapping. This is a sink that stores the exploit result, not a prerequisite."

  - id: "CA3"
    type: "DECLARATION"
    lines: [33]
    code: "uint256 public constant REWARD_RATE = 100;"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Reward rate constant. This amplifies impact but is not required for exploitability."

  - id: "CA4"
    type: "EXT_CALL"
    lines: [44]
    code: "lpToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "LP token deposit transfer. Correctly implemented."

  - id: "CA5"
    type: "STATE_MOD"
    lines: [45]
    code: "depositedLP[msg.sender] += amount;"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Deposit state update. Correctly implemented."

  - id: "CA6"
    type: "INPUT_VAL"
    lines: [73]
    code: 'require(flip == address(lpToken), "Invalid token");'
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Token validation in mintFor. Correctly validates the flip parameter."

  - id: "CA7"
    type: "COMPUTATION"
    lines: [76]
    code: "uint256 feeSum = _performanceFee + _withdrawalFee;"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Fee calculation. This is dead logic with respect to the exploit - feeSum is never used in reward calculation."

  - id: "CA8"
    type: "EXT_CALL"
    lines: [77]
    code: "lpToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), feeSum);"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Fee transfer. Incidental to exploit - attacker inflates balance via direct transfers, not this fee mechanism."

  - id: "CA9"
    type: "EXT_CALL"
    lines: [80, 81, 82]
    code: |
      uint256 hunnyRewardAmount = tokenToReward(
          lpToken.balanceOf(address(this))
      );
    security_function: "ROOT_CAUSE"
    rationale: "ROOT_CAUSE - The external call lpToken.balanceOf(address(this)) returns the TOTAL contract LP balance instead of just the fee amount. Attacker can inflate rewards by depositing LP tokens before calling mintFor. The reward should be based on feeSum, not this manipulable external call result."

  - id: "CA10"
    type: "STATE_MOD"
    lines: [85]
    code: "earnedRewards[to] += hunnyRewardAmount;"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Post-exploit assignment. Records the result of the faulty computation, not a prerequisite."

  - id: "CA11"
    type: "COMPUTATION"
    lines: [92, 93, 94]
    code: |
      function tokenToReward(uint256 lpAmount) internal pure returns (uint256) {
          return lpAmount * REWARD_RATE;
      }
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Pure math multiplication. Amplifies impact but is not required for exploitability."

  - id: "CA12"

    lines: [100, 101]
    code: |
      uint256 reward = earnedRewards[msg.sender];
      require(reward > 0, "No rewards");
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Reward claim validation. Correctly checks for non-zero rewards."

  - id: "CA13"
    type: "STATE_MOD"
    lines: [103]
    code: "earnedRewards[msg.sender] = 0;"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Clears rewards before transfer. Correctly prevents reentrancy."

  - id: "CA14"
    type: "EXT_CALL"
    lines: [104]
    code: "rewardToken.transfer(msg.sender, reward);"
    security_function: "BENIGN"

    type: "INPUT_VAL"
    lines: [111]
    code: 'require(depositedLP[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");'
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Withdrawal balance check. Correctly implemented."

  - id: "CA16"
    type: "STATE_MOD"
    lines: [112]
    code: "depositedLP[msg.sender] -= amount;"
    security_function: "BENIGN"

    type: "EXT_CALL"
    lines: [113]
    code: "lpToken.transfer(msg.sender, amount);"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "LP token withdrawal transfer. State updated before call."
