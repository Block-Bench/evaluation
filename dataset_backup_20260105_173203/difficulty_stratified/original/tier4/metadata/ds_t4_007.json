  "description": "Assert is used to check invariants. Those are states our contract or variables should never reach, ever. For example,\nif we decrease a value then it should never get bigger, only smaller.\n\nIn the given code, the Invariant contract contains a receiveMoney function that accepts Ether and \nincrements the sender's balance with the amount received. This balance is stored as an uint64.\nUnsigned integers can store values from 0 to 2^n - 1, so in this case 2^64 - 1, or roughly 18.4467 Ether.\n\nIf the sender sends more Ether than the maximum that can be stored in an uint64, \nan overflow occurs, and the value rolls over to 0 and starts incrementing from there. \nAs a result, the balance does not accurately reflect the amount of Ether received by the contract.",
