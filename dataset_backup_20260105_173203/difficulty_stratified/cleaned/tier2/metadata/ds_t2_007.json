  "description": "The contract demonstrates the dirty bytes vulnerability in Solidity < 0.8.15. When writing to temporary memory (e.g., during event emission or keccak256), leftover bytes from previous operations can pollute adjacent memory. When this memory is then copied to storage, the dirty bytes persist and become visible when the storage is later read or extended.",
