  "raw_response": "I'd be happy to help with a sanity check.\n\nOverall, the contract looks well-structured and follows good practices. However, I do have a few minor suggestions and questions to ensure everything is in order:\n\n1. **Unused variables**: In the `isGranted` function, you're using the `_where`, `_data`, and `_permissionId` variables, but immediately discarding their values using the `_where, _data, _permissionId;` statement. Consider removing these variables altogether if they're not being used.\n2. **Potential overflow**: In the `isGranted` function, you're adding `token.balanceOf(_who)` and `lockManager.getLockedBalance(_who)` to calculate `_currentBalance`. While it's unlikely, there's a potential for overflow if the token balance or locked balance is extremely large. You might want to consider using a library like `SafeMath` to handle potential overflows.\n3. **Plugin and token assumptions**: The contract assumes that the `ILockToGovernBase` plugin and the `IERC20` token are properly configured and deployed. Make sure that these assumptions are valid and that the plugin and token are correctly set up before deploying this contract.\n4. **Security contact**: The contract includes a security contact email address (`sirt@aragon.org`). Ensure that this email address is accurate and up-to-date, in case any security issues are discovered.\n5. **Testing**: Although the contract has passed your security team's audit, it's essential to perform thorough testing, including edge cases and potential attack vectors, to ensure the contract behaves as expected.\n\nThese are just minor suggestions, and the contract appears to be well-written overall. If you've addressed these points, it should be good to go for deployment.",
