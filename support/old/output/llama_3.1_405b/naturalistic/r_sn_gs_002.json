  "raw_response": "The provided smart contract code appears to be well-structured and follows good practices. However, I do have some suggestions and potential concerns:\n\n1. **Use of outdated Solidity version**: The contract is using Solidity version 0.7.6, which is outdated. Consider upgrading to a newer version, such as 0.8.x or 0.9.x, to take advantage of new features and bug fixes.\n\n2. **Potential reentrancy vulnerability**: The `collectAllProtocolFees` and `collectProtocolFees` functions call the `collectProtocolFees` function on each pool, which could potentially lead to reentrancy attacks if the pool's `collectProtocolFees` function is not properly secured. Consider using the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern to mitigate this risk.\n\n3. **Unprotected function**: The `setGaugeManager` function is not protected by any access control mechanism, allowing anyone to set the gauge manager. Consider adding a `require` statement to restrict access to this function.\n\n4. **Magic numbers**: The contract contains several magic numbers (e.g., `100_000`, `500_000`, `16384`) that are not clearly explained. Consider defining these numbers as constants with descriptive names to improve code readability.\n\n5. **Function complexity**: Some functions, such as `getSwapFee` and `getUnstakedFee`, have complex logic and multiple conditional statements. Consider breaking these functions down into smaller, more manageable pieces to improve code readability and maintainability.\n\n6. **Event emission**: The contract emits several events, but it is not clear if these events are being properly indexed or monitored. Consider adding event indexing or monitoring mechanisms to ensure that these events are properly tracked.\n\n7. **Code organization**: The contract has a mix of administrative functions (e.g., `setOwner`, `setSwapFeeManager`) and functional logic (e.g., `createPool`, `getSwapFee`). Consider separating these functions into different contracts or modules to improve code organization and maintainability.\n\n8. **Interface implementation**: The contract implements several interfaces (e.g., `ICLFactory`, `IFeeModule`), but it is not clear if these interfaces are properly defined or implemented. Consider reviewing the interface definitions and ensuring that the contract correctly implements all required functions.\n\n9. **Testing**: The contract has several complex functions and interactions, but it is not clear if these have been thoroughly tested. Consider writing comprehensive tests to ensure that the contract behaves as expected under various s",
