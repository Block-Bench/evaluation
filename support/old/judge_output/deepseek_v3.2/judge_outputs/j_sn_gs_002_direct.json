While the access control pattern is unusual, it appears to be an intentional design choice rather than an unintentional flaw. The protocolFeeManager is a trusted role, and self-management of roles is a common pattern in some protocols. The analysis does not demonstrate a concrete exploit without assuming a compromised trusted role, which violates the 'NO TRUSTED ROLE COMPROMISE REQUIRED' criterion."
