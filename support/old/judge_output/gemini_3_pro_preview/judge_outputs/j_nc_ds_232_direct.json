      "description": "The function calculates the total amount to deduct from the sender using the multiplication operator `*` without SafeMath protection: `uint256 amount = uint256(cnt) * _value;`. Since the contract uses Solidity version ^0.4.16, arithmetic operations do not automatically check for overflows. An attacker can supply a very large `_value` and a specific number of receivers (`cnt`) such that the multiplication overflows and wraps around to a small number (e.g., 0). This bypasses the balance check `balances[msg.sender] >= amount`, allowing the attacker to mint massive amounts of tokens to the receivers without having the required balance.",
