This multiplication can overflow when cnt and _value are chosen such that their product exceeds 2^256-1, wrapping around to a small value. The subsequent balance check `balances[msg.sender] >= amount` then passes with a tiny amount, but the loop transfers the full _value to each receiver, creating tokens from nothing.",
