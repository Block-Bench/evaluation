Once the correct `solution` becomes known (found off-chain or observed on-chain), any account can call `solve(solution)` repeatedly and drain the contract balance in 1000 ether increments (until the balance drops below 1000 ether, at which point calls revert). This is a concrete loss-of-funds vector due to missing state change / one-time-claim enforcement.",
