The miner of that block can bias the blockhash by iterating candidate blocks (nonce/extradata/tx set) and only publishing a block whose hash makes their own bet win, discarding losing solutions. Because prizes can be extremely large (up to millions of times the bet size, bounded only by contract balance/pay()), a miner with sufficient control can extract significant ETH from the contract.",
