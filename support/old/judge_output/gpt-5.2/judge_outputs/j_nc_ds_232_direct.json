If `_value` is chosen so that `cnt * _value` overflows `uint256`, `amount` wraps to a much smaller number. The balance check and subtraction then only deduct this small wrapped `amount`, while the loop credits each receiver with the full `_value` using SafeMath `add`. This allows an attacker to create/credit an effectively unbounded number of tokens to arbitrary addresses while paying only a tiny (overflowed) cost, breaking accounting and enabling theft/value extraction from any system that accepts this token at face value.",

This enables the well-known ERC20 allowance race condition: a spender can front-run an `approve` transaction that changes an existing non-zero allowance, spending both the old allowance and the new allowance.
