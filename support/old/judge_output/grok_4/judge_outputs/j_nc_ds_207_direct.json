In Solidity 0.4.x, ERC20 transferFrom returns a boolean indicating success, but if it fails (e.g., due to insufficient balance or lack of approval), the call returns false without reverting. The function proceeds to update the price and transfer ownership to the caller, allowing them to become the owner without successfully transferring the required tokens.",
