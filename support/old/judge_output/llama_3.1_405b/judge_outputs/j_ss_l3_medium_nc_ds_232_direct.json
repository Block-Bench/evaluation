However, the functions _0xa8ed77 and _0x208a5c use modifiers _0x900ce4 and _0xc2a854 respectively, which include require statements to check the current state of the contract. Specifically, _0x900ce4 requires the contract to not be paused, and _0xc2a854 requires the contract to be paused. This prevents the functions from being called multiple times in the same state."
