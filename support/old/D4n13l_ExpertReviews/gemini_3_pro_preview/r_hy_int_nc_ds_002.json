While standard reentrancy is mitigated by the gas limit, this is still technically a violation of Checks-Effects-Interactions. If the EVM gas costs change (as they have in the past) or if this runs on a chain with different gas rules, this becomes exploitable. More importantly, relying on gas limits is considered bad practice compared to CEI.",
