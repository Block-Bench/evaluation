The unchecked return value in WitdrawTokenToHolder is a real concern and represents the same vulnerability pattern in a different function."

The tool also flagged two PARTIAL_MATCH findings focusing on the reentrancy risk from external calls to user-supplied addresses at the same location - while these use different terminology, they are valid security concerns at the vulnerable location. Additionally, finding 4 correctly identifies the same vulnerability pattern in WitdrawTokenToHolder, which while not explicitly listed in the ground truth vulnerable functions, represents a real and exploitable issue. Overall, the tool's verdict is correct: the contract is vulnerable, and the tool effectively pointed to the vulnerable code patterns.",
