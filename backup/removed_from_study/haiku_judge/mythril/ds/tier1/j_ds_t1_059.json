The tool provided findings for both the parent and child contract classes, which is reasonable since TokenBank inherits from Token. Additionally, the tool identified a secondary concern about external calls to user-supplied addresses (reentrancy risk), which is also valid security-wise even though it's not the target vulnerability type. The 'Unchecked return value from external call' detector is semantically aligned with unchecked_return vulnerability detection. The severity level (Medium) matches the ground truth assessment.",
