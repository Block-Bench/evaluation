Finding 0, while using different terminology ('External Call To User-Supplied Address'), also flags the vulnerable location and the underlying pattern that leads to the unchecked return issue. The tool additionally identified three legitimate secondary issues in the redeem() function related to transaction order dependence and multiple chained calls without proper validation. The contract has multiple vulnerabilities, and the tool correctly prioritized the medium-severity unchecked return in Command while also identifying other valid concerns in redeem().",
