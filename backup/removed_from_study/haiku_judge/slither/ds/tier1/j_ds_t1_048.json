The Token contract's owner variable shadows the Ownable contract's owner variable, which could lead to confusion and unintended behavior.

The location (WithdrawToken function), the pattern (ignoring return value of external call), and the severity (Medium) all match the target vulnerability perfectly."

The terminology difference ('unchecked-lowlevel' vs 'unchecked_return') does not diminish the finding's value - a developer reviewing Finding 2 would immediately recognize the unchecked call() return value issue and investigate the WithdrawToken function.",
