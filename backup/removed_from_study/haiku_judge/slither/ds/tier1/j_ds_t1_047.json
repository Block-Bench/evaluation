The detector name 'unchecked-lowlevel' is semantically equivalent to 'unchecked_return' - both detect the same code pattern of ignoring return values from external calls. The location is precise (transfer function, the exact call statement), and the severity (Medium) matches the ground truth."

The call `caddress.call(id,from,_tos[i],v[i])` has no return value verification, meaning if the call fails silently (e.g., due to insufficient gas, contract doesn't exist, or execution reverts), the function will continue and return true anyway, giving a false impression of success. This is a legitimate security concern that could lead to loss of funds or inconsistent state. The tool's detector terminology ('unchecked-lowlevel') perfectly captures the vulnerability pattern.",
