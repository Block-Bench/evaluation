This type mismatch causes different function selectors, leading to the fallback function being executed instead. Slither did not flag this pattern.",

  "notes": "Slither failed to detect the interface_mismatch vulnerability in this contract. The vulnerability is a clear security issue: when `AliceCaller.callAlice()` attempts to call `IAlice(alice).set(value)` with a uint parameter, the function selector for `set(uint)` does not match the implementation's `set(int)`, causing the fallback function to execute instead (which sets `val = 1`). This is a type safety issue that traditional static analysis tools should be capable of detecting by comparing interface declarations against their implementations. The tool's lack of detection suggests either: (1) Slither does not have a detector for interface/implementation signature mismatches, or (2) its analysis capabilities are limited for Solidity version 0.4.15 code. This is a missed opportunity for the tool to help developers catch a real vulnerability that violates the principle of interface compliance.",
