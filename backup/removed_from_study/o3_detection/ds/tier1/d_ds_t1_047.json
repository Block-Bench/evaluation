It neither stores nor manages any assets and has no internal state that could be corrupted or hijacked. All token movements require the usual ERC-20 allowance granted to this contract, so no unauthorised transfers are possible. The absence of return-value checking and of length-matching between the two input arrays may lead to failed transfers or reverts, but these issues do not let an attacker steal funds or gain privileged access\u2014they only waste gas for the caller. No real, exploitable vulnerability that satisfies the stated criteria is present."
