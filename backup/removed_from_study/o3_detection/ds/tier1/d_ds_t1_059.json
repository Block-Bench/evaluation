An external attacker who is not the original deployer therefore cannot invoke any withdrawal routine or change the privileged owner. The duplicated owner variables are benign shadowing: they occupy different storage slots and are never used by the access-control modifier, so they do not create a privilege-escalation path.\n\nDeposit logic does not expose re-entrancy or arithmetic risks because it contains no external calls. Although users who send less than MinDeposit may lock their ether, this is an expected design choice, not an exploitable vulnerability, and does not allow an attacker to profit or manipulate contract state.\n\nNo functions allow untrusted callers to execute arbitrary code, overwrite storage, drain funds, or seize ownership. Consequently, the contract is considered secure against non-privileged attackers."
