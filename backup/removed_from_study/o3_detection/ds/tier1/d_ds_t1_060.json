Re-entrancy is impossible because both transfers use Solidity\u2019s transfer (2300 gas) and the Owner address is an EOA unless deliberately set to the fixed address. There are no arithmetic operations, no unchecked external call results that lead to state inconsistency, and no delegatecall patterns. Consequently, an untrusted party cannot steal or lock funds, change state, or gain unauthorized privileges.\n\nThe contract therefore presents no exploitable vulnerability under the stated threat model."
