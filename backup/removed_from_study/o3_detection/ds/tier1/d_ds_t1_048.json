All functions that move value (WithdrawToken, WithdrawToHolder, WitdrawTokenToHolder) are protected by the onlyOwner modifier, which references the owner variable declared in Ownable. This variable is set once\u2014at deployment\u2014and cannot be changed by an untrusted party, because the changeOwner function itself is restricted by the same onlyOwner modifier. The public initTokenBank function does overwrite the shadowed owner variable declared in the Token contract, but that variable is never used for authorization. Consequently, invoking initTokenBank gives an attacker no special privileges. Usage of low-level call for token transfers and ether payments does not introduce an untrusted-caller re-entrancy vector because all such calls originate from owner-only functions. No arithmetic under/over-flow, unchecked external calls reachable by the public, or other permission bypasses were identified. Therefore, within the specified threat model (owner/admin is trusted), the code is considered safe."
