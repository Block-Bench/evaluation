The target is an unchecked return in the `Command` function. This finding points to a different function (`GetHoneyFromJar`) and a different potential issue. The logic in `GetHoneyFromJar` is indeed flawed, as the transfer to `msg.sender` will always fail after the preceding transfer to `Owner`, so flagging this area is useful."
