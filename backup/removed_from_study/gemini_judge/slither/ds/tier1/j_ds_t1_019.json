      "reasoning": "The finding identifies a potential Denial of Service (DoS) vector in the `LogFile` contract. The `History` array can grow indefinitely through repeated calls to `Deposit` or `Collect`, which could lead to high gas costs (gas griefing). While the check name 'controlled-array-length' is slightly misleading (it's an unbounded append, not directly setting the length), it flags a valid, non-target vulnerability. The severity is likely lower than 'High', but the concern is real."

The location, pattern, and description are all correct."
