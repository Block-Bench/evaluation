This can lead to confusion and bugs in access control logic, as the `onlyOwner` modifier will check `Ownable.owner`, while other logic might inadvertently use `Token.owner`. This is a real vulnerability, but not the target one."

The `TokenBank` contract can receive Ether via its `payable` fallback and `Deposit` functions, but it lacks a mechanism to withdraw the contract's own Ether balance. The `WithdrawToHolder` function transfers funds between holders but doesn't allow the owner to retrieve the contract's balance. This is a valid design flaw, but not the target vulnerability."
