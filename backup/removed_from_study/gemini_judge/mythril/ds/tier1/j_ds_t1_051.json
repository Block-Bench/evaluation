This is a necessary precondition for the target vulnerability and points an auditor to the correct location and the dangerous operation, even though it doesn't specifically mention the unchecked return value. It detects a semantically related, but incomplete, part of the overall vulnerability pattern."

The function attempts to transfer the contract's entire balance twice, first to the Owner and then to msg.sender. The second transfer will fail or transfer zero. While the tool mischaracterizes this logical flaw as 'Transaction Order Dependence', it correctly flags a line involved in a legitimate and severe bug. Therefore, it's a valid bonus finding."
