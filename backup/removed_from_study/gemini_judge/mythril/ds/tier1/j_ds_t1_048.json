It reported the issue for both the base contract (`Token`) and the inheriting contract (`TokenBank`), leading to duplicate findings (1 and 3). It also correctly traced the vulnerability from a calling function (`WitdrawTokenToHolder` in finding 4). However, the tool missed another instance of an unchecked return in the `WithdrawToHolder` function (`_addr.call.value(_wei)`), indicating its detection is not exhaustive for this sample.",
