While this is an external call, it happens after all state changes (`acc.balance += msg.value`, `acc.unlockTime = ...`), so it follows the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern and is not vulnerable to reentrancy. The tool mischaracterizes this safe call as a potential risk and completely misses the actual vulnerable call in the `Collect` function."
