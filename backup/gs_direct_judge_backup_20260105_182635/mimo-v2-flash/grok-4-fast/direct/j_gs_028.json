The code correctly computes the Merkle root for these unsigned addresses as part of the overall signature verification scheme. This is not a bypass but an intended feature of the signature format. The attack scenario described would not work because the overall signature verification still requires valid signatures from other signers to meet the threshold, and the FLAG_ADDRESS entries are part of the declared configuration, not a forgery."
