      "reasoning": "The finding describes a donation attack where an attacker can deposit HYBR directly into the veNFT without receiving shares. While this is technically possible (calling deposit_for directly), it's not a vulnerability - it's a design choice. The attack benefits existing shareholders by increasing their share value, and new depositors receive fewer shares proportionally, which is mathematically correct. The system still works as intended, and there's no loss of funds or unauthorized access. This is a known DeFi pattern, not a security issue."

      "reasoning": "This is a valid, real vulnerability. The Team address defaults to address(0) and is not initialized in the constructor. When withdraw() is called, it attempts to transfer the fee NFT to Team via safeTransferFrom. If Team is address(0), the transfer will fail (most voting escrow implementations check for zero address), causing a DoS for withdrawals. This is a concrete issue with a clear attack scenario that doesn't require privileged access - any user can trigger it by calling withdraw(). The impact is denial of service for the withdrawal functionality."

      "reasoning": "The finding claims the function increments penalty without verifying token receipt. However, the function does call deposit_for which would fail if no tokens are approved/available. The real issue is that the function doesn't verify the caller actually transferred tokens, but the description is misleading. More importantly, this function is only callable by external parties sending penalty rewards - it's not a critical vulnerability as the accounting inaccuracy is limited and doesn't lead to fund loss. The function would revert anyway if deposit_for fails. This is more of an accounting issue than a security vulnerability."
