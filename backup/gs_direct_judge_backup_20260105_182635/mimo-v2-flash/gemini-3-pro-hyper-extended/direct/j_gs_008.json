The `deposit` function requires an external `transferFrom` before minting, whereas ERC4626 deposits transfer tokens internally. The core mechanism relies on a single shared veNFT. While the `calculateShares` logic is susceptible to manipulation via direct donations to the veNFT (which is a valid finding), labeling it as a specific 'ERC4626 Inflation Attack' is a mischaracterization of the contract's architecture. The underlying issue is a lack of isolation/protection against external balance manipulation of the shared veNFT."
