However, the ground truth vulnerability is about the ORDER of operations: depositing into votingEscrow BEFORE calculating shares, which affects ALL deposits, not just the first one. The finding mischaracterizes the issue by focusing on a potential gas consumption mismatch (which is not proven to exist in the code) rather than the actual logic error where totalAssets() is already increased before share calculation."

However, this is not a real vulnerability because: 1) The withdraw function is nonReentrant, so it cannot be interrupted by another call within the same transaction. 2) The voting status can only change via a separate transaction, which would require the user to submit a new withdrawal transaction. The finding describes a theoretical timing issue that doesn't constitute a real, profitable exploit scenario."
