The vulnerability allows an attacker to flash loan tokens, create proposals, vote, and execute all in one transaction without needing to lock tokens. The ground truth correctly identifies this as a flash_loan vulnerability with the root cause being that token.balanceOf() includes flashloaned amounts. Since the LLM failed to identify ANY findings, it missed the target vulnerability entirely.",
