The vulnerability exists because the signature only binds to the router address (msg.sender from pool manager's perspective), not the original end-user caller. This allows MEV bots to front-run user swaps by copying the signature and nonce, causing the legitimate user's transaction to revert due to nonce reuse. The LLM completely missed this critical vulnerability.",
