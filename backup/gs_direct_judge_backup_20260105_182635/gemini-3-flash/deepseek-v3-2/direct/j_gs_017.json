However, in the Aragon OSX architecture, the LockManager is a trusted component of the plugin system. The `vote` function is intended to be called by the LockManager (enforced by `auth(LOCK_MANAGER_PERMISSION_ID)`). Checking if the caller (the LockManager) has execution permissions is a valid design choice for automated execution. Furthermore, the finding suggests passing `_voter` instead, but the voter is not the one sending the transaction; the LockManager is. The 'bypass' described requires the LockManager to already have `EXECUTE_PROPOSAL_PERMISSION_ID`, which is not a privilege escalation but a standard permission check."
