In `_canVote`, for `VoteReplacement` mode, the check `_newVotingPower == _currentVotingPower && _voteOption == proposal_.votes[_voter].voteOption` would pass if a user tries to vote with the same option they just cleared (0 power), but more importantly, the logic in the non-replacement mode or other transitions might be affected by the stale `voteOption`. Specifically, if a user clears a vote and tries to vote for a *different* option later, the `_canVote` logic for standard voting (lines 183-187) would revert because `voteOption` is not `None` and doesn't match the new option. This effectively bricks the user's ability to re-vote after clearing."
