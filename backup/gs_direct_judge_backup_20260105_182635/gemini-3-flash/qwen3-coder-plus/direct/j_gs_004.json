The logic `if (_totalSupply == 0 || _totalAssets == 0) return amount;` is standard for vault-like contracts. The model's attack scenario describes a situation where totalAssets > 1000 due to rewards, but if rewards exist, totalSupply would already be > 0 from the initial depositor. It fails to identify the actual 'Inflation Attack' (First Depositor Attack) which relies on donating assets to the vault to make shares worth more than 1 unit of asset, causing rounding to zero for subsequent depositors."
