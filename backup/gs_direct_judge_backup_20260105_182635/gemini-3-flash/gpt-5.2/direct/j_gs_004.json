It correctly points out that `totalAssets()` only counts locked HYBR, ignoring idle HYBR in the contract. This allows a user to deposit at an undervalued share price right before a `compound()` call, effectively stealing a portion of the rewards that should have belonged to existing holders. This is a valid, high-severity issue in vault-like contracts."
