More importantly, the logic in `_attemptEarlyExecution` is a standard pattern in Aragon plugins. While it can cause a revert, it is generally considered a design trade-off for early execution rather than a critical vulnerability, as the 'decisive' voter can simply wait for the voting period to end to avoid the early execution trigger if the gas is an issue."
