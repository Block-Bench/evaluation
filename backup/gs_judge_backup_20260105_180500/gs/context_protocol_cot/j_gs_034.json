The code uses _amount0Min and _amount1Min parameters for slippage protection, and the actual liquidity received from addLiquidity is what gets deposited to the gauge. The _lp variable is correctly updated with the actual liquidity amount. There is no scenario where slippage would cause a permanent loss or incorrect state - the worst case is the transaction reverts due to slippage. The finding appears to misunderstand how the liquidity tracking works."
