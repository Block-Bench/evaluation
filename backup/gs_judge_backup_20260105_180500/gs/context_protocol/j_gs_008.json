      "reasoning": "The finding describes a sandwich attack where an operator compounds rewards between deposit and share calculation. However, the deposit function transfers HYBR first, then calls _initializeVeNFT or deposits to existing veNFT, then calculates shares. The totalAssets() is based on the veNFT's locked balance, which only changes when deposit_for is called. The sequence is: transferFrom -> deposit_for -> calculateShares -> mint. There's no window for manipulation between transfer and share calculation that would benefit an attacker. The share calculation happens AFTER the deposit increases totalAssets, so the math is correct."
