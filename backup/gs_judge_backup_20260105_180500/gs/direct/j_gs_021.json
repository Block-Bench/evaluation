The vulnerability exists because the signature only binds to the router address (msg.sender to poolManager), not the original end-user caller. This allows MEV bots to copy signed quotes, execute them first with minimal amounts, consume the nonce, and cause Alice's transaction to revert at _useUnorderedNonce(). The ground truth correctly identifies this as a front_running vulnerability in beforeSwap(). Since the LLM found 0 issues, it completely missed the target vulnerability.",
