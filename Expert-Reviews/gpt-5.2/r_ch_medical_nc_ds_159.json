The return value (`res`) is ignored, and the contract unconditionally resets state (`delete participants; tot = 0;`) even if the payout fails. This creates a concrete failure mode where a round completes but the winner is not paid, and both players' deposits remain stuck in the contract balance (effectively a loss for the participants).",
