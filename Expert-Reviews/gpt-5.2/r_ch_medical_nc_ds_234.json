Once initialized, verificationFirst is set to the *current* block (rounded down to a multiple of 10).\n\nFor any existing bet whose unitNum (the bet\u2019s target block) is *before* this newly set verificationFirst, retrieveVerification(unitNum) computes:\n  delta = (unitNum - verificationFirst) / 10\nSince uint underflows when unitNum < verificationFirst, delta becomes a huge value. The subsequent epoch check:\n  if (delta / verificationsMagnitude != signature >> 240) return 0x1000000;\nwill reliably fail because signature entries are initialized to 1 (so signature >> 240 == 0), while delta/verificationsMagnitude is nonzero for the underflowed delta.\n\nIn benefitReceived(), a signature of 0x1000000 forces:\n  prize = participant.measurement;\n(i.e., a full refund of the bet amount).\n\nThis creates a concrete \u201cfree option\u201d exploit: the attacker can claim winnings within 256 blocks when favorable (using blockhash), and otherwise force a full refund after 256 blocks by initializing verifications late, eliminating all losses and enabling bankroll-draining play until a large win occurs.]",
