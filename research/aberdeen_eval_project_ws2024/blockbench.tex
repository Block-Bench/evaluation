\section{BlockBench}

We introduce BlockBench, a benchmark comprising 263 vulnerable Solidity contracts across multiple severity levels and 13 vulnerability types, designed to distinguish genuine security understanding from pattern memorization.

We partition samples into three disjoint subsets, each targeting distinct evaluation objectives (Table~\ref{tab:dataset}).

\paragraph{Difficulty Stratified (DS, 179 samples).} Draws from SmartBugs Curated \citep{ferreira2020smartbugs}, Trail of Bits \citep{trailofbits2018}, and DeFiVulnLabs \citep{defivulnlabs2023}, stratified by severity (4 Critical, 79 High, 80 Medium, 16 Low) to assess complexity-dependent performance.

\paragraph{Temporal Contamination (TC, 50 samples).} Reconstructs well-known exploits from DeFiHackLabs \citep{defihacklabs2024} and REKT Database \citep{rekt2023}, including Nomad Bridge (\$190M), Beanstalk (\$182M), and Curve Vyper (\$70M). These attacks appear extensively in training corpora, enabling memorization versus understanding assessment.

\paragraph{Gold Standard (GS, 34 samples).} Derives from professional audits by Spearbit \citep{spearbit2025}, MixBytes \citep{mixbytes2025}, and Code4rena \citep{code4rena2025} conducted after September 2025, postdating all model training cutoffs. This temporal separation guarantees zero contamination.

\paragraph{Coverage.} Spans 13 vulnerability classes dominated by Access Control (46), Reentrancy (43), and Logic Errors (31). TC emphasizes oracle manipulation, GS focuses on subtle logic errors, DS provides broad coverage.
