\section{Related Work}

Traditional analysis tools like Slither \citep{feist2019slither}, Mythril \citep{mueller2017mythril}, and Securify \citep{tsankov2018securify} detect vulnerabilities through static analysis and symbolic execution, achieving reasonable precision but struggling with complex semantic flaws \citep{durieux2020empirical}. Recent LLM approaches show promise, with GPTLens \citep{hu2023gptlens} and PropertyGPT \citep{liu2024propertygpt} achieving 90\%+ accuracy on benchmarks, though performance degrades on real contracts \citep{ince2025gendetect}. Existing benchmarks like SmartBugs \citep{ferreira2020smartbugs} focus on detection accuracy without distinguishing genuine understanding from pattern recognition. Our work addresses this gap through adversarial transformations probing memorization versus reasoning, extending robustness evaluation techniques \citep{sanchez2025none,wu2024reasoning} to blockchain security.
