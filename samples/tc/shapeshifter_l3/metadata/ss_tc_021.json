  "description": "Inverse Finance accepted Yearn Curve 3crypto LP tokens as collateral, with pricing from an oracle that read Curve's get_virtual_price(). An attacker used flash loans to add massive liquidity to the Curve pool, temporarily inflating the virtual_price. This allowed borrowing far more than the collateral's true value, as the oracle reported the manipulated inflated price.",
  "attack_scenario": "1) Flash loan 2700 WBTC from Aave. 2) Add 2677.5 WBTC + 22,500 USDT to Curve 3crypto pool. 3) Massive liquidity addition inflates Curve virtual_price from $1.00 to ~$1.50. 4) Deposit yvCrv3Crypto tokens as collateral. 5) Oracle reads inflated price, valuing collateral 50% higher than true worth. 6) Borrow maximum DOLA based on inflated collateral value (80% of $1.50 = $1.20 per token vs should be $0.80). 7) Remove liquidity from Curve, price normalizes. 8) Repay flash loan, keep overborrowed $15.6M DOLA.",
  "vulnerable_contract": "SyntheticLending",
  "root_cause": "The price oracle for Yearn Curve 3crypto LP tokens relied on Curve's get_virtual_price() which reflects current pool state. Flash loan attackers added massive liquidity in one transaction, inflating virtual_price. The oracle had no time-weighted averaging or manipulation resistance, so it reported the inflated price, allowing massive overborrowing.",

  "fix": "Implement time-weighted average price (TWAP) oracles. Use exponential moving averages (EMA) for price feeds. Add minimum delays between price updates. Use multiple independent oracle sources (e.g., Chainlink + Curve). Implement manipulation-resistant LP token pricing formulas that account for potential imbalances.",
