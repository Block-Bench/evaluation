  "description": "Curve-style pool with reentrancy vulnerability due to CEI (Checks-Effects-Interactions) violation. The add_liquidity() function mints LP tokens before making an external call, allowing an attacker to reenter and mint LP tokens multiple times. Note: This Solidity sample models the behavior of the original Vyper exploit but represents a standard CEI violation rather than a compiler bug.",

  ],
  "attack_scenario": "Attacker calls add_liquidity() with ETH. During the external call in _handleETHTransfer(), attacker's receive() function is triggered. Attacker reenters add_liquidity() before the first call completes. Since LP tokens were already minted in the first call (before external call), the reentrant call mints additional LP tokens based on the already-updated state. Attacker removes liquidity with inflated LP balance, extracting more assets than deposited.",
  "root_cause": "CEI violation in add_liquidity(): LP tokens are minted (state change) before the external call to _handleETHTransfer(). The reentrancy guard variables are declared but never used in any modifier, leaving the function unprotected against recursive calls during the ETH transfer callback.",
  "fix_description": "Apply reentrancy guard modifier to add_liquidity() function. Follow Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern by moving external calls after all state changes. Alternatively, use OpenZeppelin ReentrancyGuard or implement proper nonReentrant modifier using the declared _status variable.",
