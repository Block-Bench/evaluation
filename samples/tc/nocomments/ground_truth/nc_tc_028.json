  "description": "Orbit Chain bridge suffered an $81M exploit when attackers compromised validator private keys and used them to forge signatures authorizing fraudulent cross-chain withdrawals. The bridge's multi-sig system (5-of-7) was bypassed through key compromise rather than smart contract vulnerabilities.",
  "root_cause": "Compromised validator private keys enabled signature forgery\n\nKey Weaknesses: Insufficient validator key security; Weak on-chain signature verification; Low multi-sig threshold (5/7)",
  "attack_scenario": "Attackers gained access to 5 out of 7 validator keys and created valid ECDSA signatures for fake withdrawal transactions\n\nAttack Flow: Attackers compromise 5 of 7 validator private keys through phishing or malware \u2192 Create fraudulent withdrawal transactions claiming deposits on Orbit Chain \u2192 Generate valid ECDSA signatures using compromised validator keys \u2192 Call withdraw() with forged but cryptographically valid signatures \u2192 Bridge validates signature count (5 >= threshold) and processes withdrawal \u2192 Drain $81M across WBTC, ETH, USDT, USDC, and other tokens",
  "fix_description": "Implement hardware security modules (HSMs) for validator keys; Use multi-party computation (MPC) for distributed key management; Increase multi-sig threshold (e.g., 7-of-10)",
