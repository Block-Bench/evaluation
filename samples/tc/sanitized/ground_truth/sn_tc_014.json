  "description": "Arbitrary external call vulnerability in controller's swap function. The swapExactJarForJar function accepted user-provided target addresses and calldata, making unchecked external calls that drained strategy funds.",
  "root_cause": "Controller allowed arbitrary external calls with user-provided targets and data without validation. Strategy functions like withdrawAll() lacked access control checks, allowing controller to call them on behalf of attacker.",
  "attack_scenario": "Attacker created fake jar contracts, called swapExactJarForJar with malicious targets pointing to real strategies and calldata encoding withdrawAll(). Controller executed these calls, draining strategies.",
  "fix_description": "Remove arbitrary call functionality. Implement specific swap logic directly. Add access control to all strategy functions (require msg.sender == controller). If arbitrary calls needed, use strict whitelisting of targets and function selectors.",
