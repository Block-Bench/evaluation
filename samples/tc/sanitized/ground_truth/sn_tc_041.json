  "description": "DeltaPrime suffered a $4.75M exploit when attackers compromised an admin private key with upgrade privileges. They upgraded a pool contract to inject malicious code, then exploited the backdoored contract to drain funds through fake pair contracts and balance manipulation.",
  "root_cause": "Single private key compromise allowed arbitrary contract upgrades without timelock or multi-sig\n\nKey Weaknesses: Single private key controls upgrades; No multi-sig requirement; Missing timelock delay",
