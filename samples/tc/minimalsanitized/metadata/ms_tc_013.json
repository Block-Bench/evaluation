  "description": "Transfer callback manipulation allowing state inconsistency. The transfer function updated balances then called _notifyTransfer which triggered callbacks, allowing repeated transfers with stale state calculations.",
  "root_cause": "Token transfer function called external contract during state update. Callback occurred after balance updates but before finalization, creating state inconsistency exploitable through repeated self-transfers.",
  "attack_scenario": "Attacker minted tokens, then transferred to self 4 times in loop. Each transfer triggered callback with inconsistent state. After iterations, token balance inflated. Burned inflated tokens back to ETH for profit.",
