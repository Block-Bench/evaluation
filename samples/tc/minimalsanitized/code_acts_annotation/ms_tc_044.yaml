      uint256 cash = underlying.balanceOf(address(this));
      uint256 totalUnderlying = cash + totalBorrows - totalReserves;
      return (totalUnderlying * 1e18) / totalSupply;
    security_function: "ROOT_CAUSE"
    rationale: "ROOT_CAUSE - Exchange rate uses balanceOf() which includes donated tokens. When totalSupply is tiny (e.g., 1 wei), donations massively inflate the rate. Attacker donates to inflate 1 token's collateral value."

    rationale: "Zero-supply branch. Part of same lifecycle invariant as CA1 - not an independent prerequisite. Bootstrap condition context."
