      function mint(address to, uint256 amount) external onlyMinter {
          _mint(to, amount);
          emit Minted(to, amount);
      }
    security_function: "ROOT_CAUSE"
    rationale: "ROOT_CAUSE - mint() protected only by single minter key. No supply cap, no multi-sig, no timelock. Compromised minter key allows unlimited token minting ($290M exploited)."

  - id: "CA2"
    type: "STATE_MOD"
    lines: [54, 55, 57, 58, 60, 61]
    code: |
      function _mint(address to, uint256 amount) internal {
          require(to != address(0), "Mint to zero address");

          emit Transfer(address(0), to, amount);
      }
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Internal _mint implementation. Not externally reachable - the vulnerability is exposed through CA1. Supply cap absence is consequence, not independent cause."

    code: |
      function setMinter(address newMinter) external onlyMinter {
          minter = newMinter;
      }
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Role rotation function. Post-compromise persistence path - not required for exploitation. Compromised key already satisfies onlyMinter."

    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Correctly implemented modifier. The weakness is the architectural choice (single-key minting authority) captured in CA1, not the modifier itself."
