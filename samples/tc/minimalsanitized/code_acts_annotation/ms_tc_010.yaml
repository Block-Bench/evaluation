    code: "mapping(address => uint256) public borrowed;"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Borrowed amount mapping declaration. Storage existence is not the vulnerability."

  - id: "CA3"
    type: "DECLARATION"
    lines: [21]
    code: "mapping(address => bool) public inMarket;"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Market participation flag declaration. Storage existence is not the vulnerability."

  - id: "CA4"
    type: "STATE_MOD"
    lines: [35, 36, 37]
    code: |
      deposits[msg.sender] += msg.value;
      totalDeposits += msg.value;
      inMarket[msg.sender] = true;
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Deposit function state updates. Correctly implemented."

  - id: "CA5"
    type: "INPUT_VAL"
    lines: [47, 48]
    code: |
      uint256 totalDebt = borrowed[account] + additionalBorrow;
      if (totalDebt == 0) return true;
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Debt calculation in isHealthy. Correctly returns true if no debt."

  - id: "CA6"
    type: "INPUT_VAL"
    lines: [51]
    code: "if (!inMarket[account]) return false;"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Market check in isHealthy. This is validation logic whose ordering is violated, not a prerequisite."

  - id: "CA7"
    type: "COMPUTATION"
    lines: [53, 54]
    code: |
      uint256 collateralValue = deposits[account];
      return collateralValue >= (totalDebt * COLLATERAL_FACTOR) / 100;
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Collateral ratio calculation. Math is correct."

  - id: "CA8"
    type: "INPUT_VAL"
    lines: [58, 59]
    code: |
      require(amount > 0, "Invalid amount");
      require(address(this).balance >= amount, "Insufficient funds");
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Basic input validation in borrow(). Correctly implemented."

  - id: "CA9"
    type: "INPUT_VAL"
    lines: [62]
    code: 'require(isHealthy(msg.sender, amount), "Insufficient collateral");'
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Initial health check. Correctly implemented validation."

  - id: "CA10"
    type: "STATE_MOD"
    lines: [65, 66]
    code: |
      borrowed[msg.sender] += amount;
      totalBorrowed += amount;
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "State update BEFORE external call. This is actually protective - it limits same-function reentrancy. The exploit relies on cross-function state manipulation (exitMarket)."

  - id: "CA11"
    type: "EXT_CALL"
    lines: [68, 69]
    code: |
      (bool success, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: amount}("");
      require(success, "Transfer failed");
    security_function: "ROOT_CAUSE"
    rationale: "ROOT_CAUSE - External call sending ETH before final health check. Attacker can reenter during this call. While borrowed state is updated, attacker can manipulate other state (exitMarket) to affect health calculations."

  - id: "CA12"
    type: "INPUT_VAL"
    lines: [71]
    code: 'require(isHealthy(msg.sender, 0), "Health check failed");'
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Post-call health check. This is a consequence of the CEI violation, not the root cause. The check itself is correct - the issue is that it's evaluated after state can be manipulated."

  - id: "CA13"
    type: "INPUT_VAL"
    lines: [75]
    code: 'require(borrowed[msg.sender] == 0, "Outstanding debt");'
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Debt check in exitMarket. This is an attacker-called function, not a prerequisite."

  - id: "CA14"
    type: "STATE_MOD"
    lines: [76]
    code: "inMarket[msg.sender] = false;"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Sets inMarket to false. This is an attacker action during reentrancy, not a prerequisite."

  - id: "CA15"
    type: "INPUT_VAL"
    lines: [83, 84]
    code: |
      require(deposits[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient deposits");
      require(!inMarket[msg.sender], "Exit market first");
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Withdrawal validation. Correctly requires exiting market first."

  - id: "CA16"
    type: "STATE_MOD"
    lines: [86, 87]
    code: |
      deposits[msg.sender] -= amount;
      totalDeposits -= amount;
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Withdrawal state updates. Correctly implemented."

  - id: "CA17"
    type: "EXT_CALL"
    lines: [89]
    code: "payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "ETH transfer in withdraw. Uses transfer() with 2300 gas limit."
