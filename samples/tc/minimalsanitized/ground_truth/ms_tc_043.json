  "description": "PlayDapp's PLA token suffered a $290M exploit when attackers compromised a private key with minting privileges. They minted 1.79 billion tokens without restrictions, causing a 90% price collapse. The attack was repeated on the migration contract, demonstrating persistent access control vulnerabilities.",
  "root_cause": "Single private key controlled unlimited minting function without supply cap or multi-sig\n\nKey Weaknesses: Single minter key with unlimited power; No supply cap enforcement; No multi-signature requirement",
  "attack_scenario": "Compromise minter key, call mint() repeatedly to create billions of tokens, dump on DEXes\n\nAttack Flow: Attacker compromises private key with MINTER_ROLE \u2192 Call mint(attackerAddress, 1_790_000_000 * 10**18) \u2192 Receive 1.79 billion PLA tokens (~$290M at time) \u2192 Sell tokens across Uniswap, PancakeSwap, other DEXes \u2192 Token price crashes from $0.16 to $0.016 (90% drop) \u2192 PlayDapp deploys new token contract for migration \u2192 Attacker gains access to new contract's minter key \u2192 Mint additional 1.59 billion tokens on new contract \u2192 Further market damage and user confidence loss",
  "fix_description": "Implement hard supply cap: MAX_SUPPLY = 1B tokens; Require multi-signature (3-of-5) for all minting; Add timelock delay (24-48 hours) for mint operations",
