    "root_cause": "The vault calculated share prices using getTotalAssets() which included current balances in Curve pools. These balances could be manipulated via large swaps within a single transaction. The protocol used spot prices instead of time-weighted average prices (TWAP), and had no protection against flash loan manipulation or slippage limits on price changes.",
    "attack_vector": "Attacker takes $50M USDC + $17M USDT flash loans from Uniswap. Swaps USDT->USDC on Curve to inflate USDC price. Deposits 49M USDC into Harvest at inflated price, receiving more fUSDC shares. Swaps USDC->USDT to deflate price. Withdraws fUSDC shares at normal price, receiving more USDC than deposited. Repeats cycle 6 times to amplify profit. Repays flash loans with $24M profit.",
    "impact": "Funds lost: $24,000,000",
    "correct_fix": "Use Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) oracles instead of spot prices from AMMs. Implement deposit/withdrawal fees to make flash loan attacks unprofitable. Add slippage protection on all swaps. Limit maximum deposit/withdrawal amounts per block. Use multiple price sources (Chainlink oracles). Implement commit-reveal pattern for deposits/withdrawals. Add minimum time delay between deposits and withdrawals."
