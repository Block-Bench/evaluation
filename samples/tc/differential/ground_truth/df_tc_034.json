  "root_cause": "Oracle returns spot price calculated from current Curve pool balances. Flash loans can manipulate pool balances within a single transaction to inflate/deflate reported prices.\n\nKey Weaknesses: No Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP); Reliance on spot prices from Curve pools; No external price feed validation",
  "attack_scenario": "Drain Curve pool liquidity to manipulate sUSDE price, deposit at inflated value, borrow maximum assets\n\nAttack Flow: Obtain massive flashloans from Aave V3, Balancer, Spark, MorphoBlue, MakerDAO \u2192 Execute large swaps in sUSDE/USDe, USDe/DAI, USDe/crvUSD Curve pools \u2192 Drain pool liquidity to create price imbalance \u2192 UwU Lend oracle reads manipulated spot price from Curve \u2192 sUSDE price artificially inflated to 2x real value \u2192 Deposit sUSDE into UwU Lend at inflated price \u2192 Collateral appears worth 2x actual value due to manipulation \u2192 Borrow maximum WETH, DAI, USDC, WBTC at 85% LTV \u2192 Extract $19.3M worth of assets \u2192 Reverse Curve swaps to restore price \u2192 Position now undercollateralized but attacker extracted value \u2192 Repay flashloans with profits",
