  "attack_scenario": "Attacker minted tokens, then transferred to self 4 times in loop. Each transfer triggered callback with inconsistent state. After iterations, token balance inflated. Burned inflated tokens back to ETH for profit.",
  "fix_description": "Add reentrancy guard to transfer function. Remove callbacks from transfer entirely, or ensure all state updates complete before any external calls. Use CEI pattern strictly.",
