  "description": "Fixed version with minimal changes to address the vulnerability",
  "root_cause": "The permit validation used try-catch that swallowed failures without reverting. The function proceeded with token operations regardless of whether the permit succeeded, effectively bypassing authorization checks entirely.",
  "attack_scenario": "1) Attacker called anySwapOutUnderlyingWithPermit with victim's token address. 2) Passed invalid permit signature (v=0, r=0, s=0). 3) Permit validation failed silently. 4) Function continued executing anyway. 5) Tokens were burned/locked and bridged to destination chain. 6) Repeated to drain $8M worth of WETH and other tokens.",
  "fix_description": "Require permit to succeed: remove try-catch or explicitly check return value. Alternatively, require existing approval if permit fails. Never proceed with token operations without verified authorization.",
