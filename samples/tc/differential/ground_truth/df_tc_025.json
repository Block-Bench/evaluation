  "attack_scenario": "1) Deflationary token charges 10% fee on transfers. 2) Attacker deposits 100 tokens. 3) Vault receives only 90 tokens (10% burned as fee). 4) Vault credits attacker's account with full 100 tokens. 5) Attacker withdraws 100 tokens. 6) Vault sends 100 but only had 90 plus other users' funds. 7) Repeated deposits/withdrawals to drain $8.5M.",
