  "description": "Fixed version with minimal changes to address the vulnerability",
  "root_cause": "Cross-function reentrancy. Borrow sent ETH (triggering callback) before final validation. Attacker called exitMarket during callback, modifying shared state (inMarket) and bypassing health checks.",
  "attack_scenario": "Attacker deposited collateral and entered market, called borrow to get ETH. During ETH transfer callback, attacker called exitMarket to remove collateral requirement. Final health check used stale state, allowing over-borrowing.",
  "fix_description": "Use global ReentrancyGuard on all functions that share state. Perform all validations after external calls. Prevent exitMarket when positions are open. Consider mutex locks for cross-function protection.",
