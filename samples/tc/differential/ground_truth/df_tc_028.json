  "description": "Fixed version with proper signature verification using ecrecover",
  "root_cause": "The withdraw function accepts signatures but does not verify them. It only checks the signature count without validating that signatures are from registered validators using ecrecover.\n\nKey Weaknesses: Insufficient validator key security; Weak on-chain signature verification; Low multi-sig threshold (5/7)",
  "attack_scenario": "Attackers gained access to 5 out of 7 validator keys and created valid ECDSA signatures for fake withdrawal transactions\n\nAttack Flow: Attackers compromise 5 of 7 validator private keys through phishing or malware \u2192 Create fraudulent withdrawal transactions claiming deposits on Orbit Chain \u2192 Generate valid ECDSA signatures using compromised validator keys \u2192 Call withdraw() with forged but cryptographically valid signatures \u2192 Bridge validates signature count (5 >= threshold) and processes withdrawal \u2192 Drain $81M across WBTC, ETH, USDT, USDC, and other tokens",
  "fix_description": "Implement hardware security modules (HSMs) for validator keys; Use multi-party computation (MPC) for distributed key management; Increase multi-sig threshold (e.g., 7-of-10)",
