  "attack_scenario": "Rogue developer upgrades LockManager, modifies user withdrawal addresses, drains all locked funds\n\nAttack Flow: Rogue developer (DPRK operative) hired by project with admin access \u2192 Developer prepares malicious LockManager implementation \u2192 Uses admin key to upgrade contract without review \u2192 For each user: setLockRecipient(user, attackerWallet) \u2192 Calls emergencyUnlock() for all users \u2192 Funds flow to attacker's controlled addresses ($62M total) \u2192 Transfers to external wallets for mixing \u2192 Project traces identity, discovers DPRK link \u2192 Negotiations result in full fund return (unusual outcome) \u2192 All users compensated, project continues operations",
