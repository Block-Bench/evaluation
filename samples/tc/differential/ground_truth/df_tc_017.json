  "attack_scenario": "1) Flash loan 5M DAI. 2) Swap DAI -> ETH in Uniswap pool, heavily imbalancing reserves (6M DAI, 100 ETH). 3) LP token value calculation uses manipulated reserves, showing inflated value. 4) Deposit LP tokens as collateral in Warp Finance. 5) Borrow maximum stablecoins based on inflated collateral valuation (2-3x more than true value). 6) Swap back to rebalance pool. 7) Repay flash loan. 8) Keep overborrowed funds. Loss: $7.7M.",
