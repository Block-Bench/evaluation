  "description": "Fixed version with proper exchange rate from oracle instead of hardcoded 1:1",
  "root_cause": "The mint() function uses msg.value directly as uniBTCAmount (1:1 ratio) regardless of actual ETH/BTC exchange rate. getExchangeRate() returns hardcoded 1e18. This allows users to mint BTC-pegged tokens at incorrect rates.\n\nKey Weaknesses: Hardcoded 1:1 ETH:BTC exchange rate; No price oracle integration; Missing exchange rate validation",
  "attack_scenario": "Mint uniBTC by depositing ETH at incorrect 1:1 rate, swap uniBTC for real BTC-pegged assets at market rate\n\nAttack Flow: Obtain 30,800 ETH flashloan from Balancer (~$92M) \u2192 Call mint() depositing 30,800 ETH \u2192 Contract incorrectly assumes 1 ETH = 1 BTC \u2192 Receive 30,800 uniBTC tokens (real value: ~$2B) \u2192 Swap uniBTC for WBTC on Uniswap V3 pool \u2192 Due to liquidity limits, receive ~30 WBTC (~$2M) \u2192 Swap WBTC back to ETH via Uniswap \u2192 Repay 30,800 ETH flashloan to Balancer \u2192 Keep net profit: ~$1.7-2M",
