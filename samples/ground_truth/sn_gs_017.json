    "root_cause": "In MinVotingPowerCondition.isGranted() at line 45, the function checks 'token.balanceOf(_who) + lockManager.getLockedBalance(_who)'. If an address holds tokens but can't spend them due to being frozen or blacklisted (like USDC/USDT blacklist), they are still granted access to create proposals. The intended behavior should be to not allow calling createProposal as the tokens are not actually transferable.",
    "attack_vector": "1. User holds 1000 USDC but is blacklisted by Circle.\n2. User cannot actually transfer or lock their tokens.\n3. User calls createProposal().\n4. isGranted() at line 45 checks token.balanceOf(user) which returns 1000.\n5. User passes the minProposerVotingPower check despite having unusable tokens.\n6. User can spam create proposals without genuine stake in governance.",
    "impact": "Severity: medium",
    "correct_fix": "Do not use token.balanceOf(_who), rather actually require the tokens to be locked in LockManager by making a transfer. Only check lockManager.getLockedBalance(_who) for voting power, removing the token.balanceOf() portion."
