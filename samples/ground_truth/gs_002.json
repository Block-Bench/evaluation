  "description": "The factory silently clamps dynamic fees above 10% to a low default, misleading governance about effective fee rates.",
  "root_cause": "Governance can configure DynamicSwapFeeModule with fees up to 50%, but CLFactory.getSwapFee discards any value above 100_000 ppm (10%) and falls back to the tick-spacing default (often 500 ppm = 0.05%) without reverting or logging. The silent fallback misleads governance into believing higher fees are active.",
  "attack_scenario": "Governance sets protective high fee (e.g., 20% during launch anti-MEV), but the effective fee drops back to default (e.g., 0.05%). Traders are charged far less than intended, defeating protective or revenue objectives. The misconfiguration persists unnoticed.",
  "fix_description": "Either revert when the module returns > 100_000 or raise the factory ceiling to match the module's cap. Emit events or add admin tooling to surface out-of-range configurations.",
