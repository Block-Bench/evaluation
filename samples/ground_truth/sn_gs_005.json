    "root_cause": "Before describing the vulnerability, we should know that in ve3.3 systems, `poke` is important to make anyone reflect the decaying vote weight to prevent users from being inactive on votes to have their full weight votes on a pool. In `VoterV3` users choose what pools they want to vote for and the contract retrieves their `ve` weight upon doing so: uint256 _weight = IVotingEscrow(_ve).balanceOfNFT(_tokenId); And upon voting for a pool, that weight affects the claimable share distribution of that pool compared to other pools. Since now we know the importance of the voting weight, and since ve NFT weight decay with time, there is a poke function to update the voting weight made on a pool previously to the decayed weight of that NFT. The `poke()` function is guarded to be called by the owner or through the `ve` contract which can have anyone depositing for a user or increasing his locked value even by `1wei` to poke him to reflect his new decayed weight on the voted pools. An attacker can do the following: 1. vote his full weight - 1wei on a dedicated pool 2. vote 1 wei on another pool 3. time passes with inactivity from his side - his ve decay but is not reflected on voted pools 4. users try to poke() him through known functions of the ve contract 5. poke() function reverts here File: VoterV3.sol 208: uint256 _poolWeight = _weights[i] * _weight / _totalVoteWeight; 209:  210: require(votes[_tokenId][_pool] == 0, \"ZV\"); 211: require(_poolWeight != 0, \"ZV\"); Since the `1wei` vote multiplied by the decayed weight divided by totalVoteWeight rounds down to 0, hence this user becomes unpokable. Impact: The voted for pool will have inflated rewards distributed to him compared to other pools that have pokable users. Thinking of this attack at scale, the user will have advantage of having full voting weight if he votes immediately like having permanent lock weight without actually locking his balance permanently. Preventing anyone from preserving this invariant `A single veNFT\u2019s total vote allocation \u2264 its available voting power.` on his vote balance too.",
