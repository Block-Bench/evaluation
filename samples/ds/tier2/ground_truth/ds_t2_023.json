  "description": "The splitDAO() function makes an external call to transfer Ether before updating internal state. An attacker can deploy a contract with a fallback function that re-enters splitDAO() before the balance is decremented, draining funds through recursive withdrawals. This is the classic DAO hack vulnerability pattern.",
  "fix_description": "Apply the checks-effects-interactions pattern: update balances and state variables before making external calls. Use a ReentrancyGuard mutex or OpenZeppelin's nonReentrant modifier.",
