  "description": "The sendCoin() function is vulnerable to the ERC20 short address attack. When an address with trailing zeros is provided without the full 20 bytes, the EVM pads the missing bytes from the next parameter (amount), effectively multiplying the transfer amount. This can lead to unauthorized large transfers.",
