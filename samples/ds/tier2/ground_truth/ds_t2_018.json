  "description": "Manipulation of the txGasPrice value, which can result in unintended consequences and potential financial losses.\n\nIn the calculateTotalFee function, the total fee is calculated by multiplying gasUsed + GAS_OVERHEAD_NATIVE with txGasPrice. \nThe issue is that the txGasPrice value can be manipulated by an attacker, potentially leading to an inflated fee calculation.",
