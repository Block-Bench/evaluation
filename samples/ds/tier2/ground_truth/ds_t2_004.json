  "description": "The EtherGame Self-Destruct Vulnerability is a flaw in the smart contract code that allows an attacker \nto disrupt the game by causing the EtherGame contract to self-destruct (using the selfdestruct opcode). \nThe vulnerability arises due to the dos function in the Attack contract, which performs a self-destruct\noperation on the EtherGame contract after receiving a significant amount of Ether. As a result of the self-destruct, \nthe EtherGame contract's functionality is permanently disabled, making it impossible for anyone to deposit or claim the winner's reward.",
  "fix_description": "Instead of relying on this.balance to track the deposited Ether, \nuse a state variable to keep track of the total deposited amount.",
