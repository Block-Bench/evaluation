  "description": "The IamMissing() function is intended to be a constructor but is declared as a regular public function. In Solidity < 0.5, constructors were defined by naming a function the same as the contract. This function has a different name, so anyone can call it after deployment to become the owner.",
  "fix_description": "Use the constructor keyword (Solidity >= 0.5) instead of naming functions after the contract. For older versions, ensure the function name exactly matches the contract name.",
