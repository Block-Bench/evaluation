  "fix_description": "Avoid any situation that if the numerator is smaller than the denominator, the result will be zero.\nRounding down related issues can be avoided in many ways:\n    1.Using libraries for rounding up/down as expected\n    2.Requiring result is not zero or denominator is <= numerator\n    3.Refactor operations for avoiding first dividing then multiplying, when first dividing then multiplying, precision lost is amplified",
