  "description": "This demonstrates the difference between using 'return' and 'break' in nested loop iterations. When removing multiple banks from a list, using 'return' in the inner loop will prematurely exit the function after removing only the first bank, leaving other banks untouched. In contrast, using 'break' correctly exits only the current inner loop iteration, allowing the outer loop to continue processing other banks. The contracts BankManagerA and BankManagerB implement different approaches to bank removal.",
  "fix_description": "Use break instead of return when you only want to exit the current loop, not the entire function.",
