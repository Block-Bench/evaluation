  "description": "In TokenWhale contract's approveAndCallcode function. The vulnerability allows an \narbitrary call to be executed with arbitrary data, leading to potential security risks\nand unintended consequences. The function uses a low-level call (_spender.call(_extraData))\nto execute code from the _spender address without any validation or checks on the provided _extraData.\nThis can lead to unexpected behavior, reentrancy attacks, or unauthorized operations.\n\nThis excersise is about  a low level call to a contract where input and return values are not checked\nIf the call data is controllable, it is easy to cause arbitrary function execution.",
