  "description": "Logic error using 'return' instead of 'break' in nested loop. When removing multiple banks from a list, using 'return' in the inner loop prematurely exits the entire function after removing only the first matching bank, leaving other banks untouched. The correct approach is to use 'break' to exit only the inner loop while allowing the outer loop to continue.",
