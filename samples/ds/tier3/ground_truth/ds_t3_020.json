  "description": "The Test1 contract's Test() function uses 'var i1 = 1' which infers type uint8 from the literal value 1. The loop appears to transfer msg.value*2, but uint8 overflows after 255 iterations, causing i2 to hold a small value instead of the expected double amount. Users receive far less than the apparent promised return.",
