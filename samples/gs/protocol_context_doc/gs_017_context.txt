PROTOCOL CONTEXT: Aragon - Lock-to-Vote Plugin

PROTOCOL TYPE: DAO Governance / Voting Plugin

OVERVIEW:
LockToVotePlugin is the main governance plugin for the Aragon Lock-to-Vote system. It handles proposal creation, vote tallying, threshold calculations, and proposal execution. Voting thresholds are calculated based on participation relative to total token supply.

BUSINESS MODEL:
- Authorized users create proposals with a set of executable actions
- Proposals have configurable participation and approval thresholds
- Thresholds are calculated as a percentage of total token supply
- Token holders vote on proposals through the LockManager
- Proposals pass when they meet both participation and approval requirements
