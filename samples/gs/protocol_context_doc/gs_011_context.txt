PROTOCOL CONTEXT: Aragon - Lock-to-Vote Plugin

PROTOCOL TYPE: DAO Governance / Voting Plugin

OVERVIEW:
Lock-to-Vote is an Aragon DAO plugin that enables token-weighted governance where users must lock tokens to participate in voting. It supports multiple voting modes including early execution when sufficient support is reached before the voting period ends.

BUSINESS MODEL:
- Token holders lock tokens in a LockManager to gain voting power
- Users vote on proposals using their locked token weight
- Proposals can be configured for early execution if sufficient support is reached
- The plugin executes proposal actions when voting concludes successfully
- Tokens remain locked until the user explicitly unlocks them
