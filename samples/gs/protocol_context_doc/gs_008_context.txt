PROTOCOL CONTEXT: Hybra Finance - GrowthHYBR (gHYBR)

PROTOCOL TYPE: Liquid Staking / Governance Wrapper

OVERVIEW:
GrowthHYBR is a liquid staking wrapper that allows users to participate in vote-escrowed (ve) tokenomics without locking their tokens individually. The protocol pools user deposits into a single veNFT position, providing liquidity while still capturing governance rewards.

BUSINESS MODEL:
- Users deposit the native HYBR token and receive gHYBR shares in return
- The protocol locks deposited tokens into a veNFT (vote-escrowed NFT) for maximum duration
- gHYBR shares represent proportional ownership of the pooled veNFT
- Rewards from voting (bribes, rebases) are auto-compounded back into the veNFT
- Users can withdraw by burning gHYBR shares, receiving a proportional slice of the veNFT
