PROTOCOL CONTEXT: Aragon - LockManager ERC20

PROTOCOL TYPE: Token Locking / Governance Infrastructure

OVERVIEW:
LockManagerERC20 is the ERC20-specific implementation of the Aragon Lock-to-Vote lock manager. It handles the custody of users' ERC20 tokens when they lock them to participate in governance, tracking locked balances and managing token transfers.

BUSINESS MODEL:
- Users lock ERC20 tokens to participate in DAO governance
- The contract holds tokens on behalf of users and tracks their locked balances
- Locked balances determine voting power in connected governance plugins
- Users can unlock tokens when not actively participating in proposals
- Token transfers occur when locking (user to contract) and unlocking (contract to user)
