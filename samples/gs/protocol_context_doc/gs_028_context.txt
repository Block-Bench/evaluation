PROTOCOL CONTEXT: Sequence - Smart Wallet Signature Validation

PROTOCOL TYPE: Smart Contract Wallet / Account Abstraction

OVERVIEW:
Sequence is a smart contract wallet system that supports complex signature validation including multi-sig, session keys, and checkpointers. The BaseSig module handles signature recovery and validation, supporting different signature types and optional checkpointer integration for enhanced security.

BUSINESS MODEL:
- Users control smart contract wallets through cryptographic signatures
- Multiple signature types supported (single, multi-sig, session-based, chained)
- Checkpointers can enforce additional validation rules on wallet operations
- Chained signatures allow proving validity against historical wallet configurations
- Signature flags control which validation features are active
