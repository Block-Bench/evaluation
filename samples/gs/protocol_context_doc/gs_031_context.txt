PROTOCOL CONTEXT: Sequence - ERC-4337 Validation Module

PROTOCOL TYPE: Smart Contract Wallet / Account Abstraction

OVERVIEW:
Sequence smart wallets support ERC-4337 account abstraction, allowing transactions to be submitted through bundlers instead of requiring users to hold ETH for gas. The ERC4337v07 module handles UserOperation validation as required by the ERC-4337 standard.

BUSINESS MODEL:
- Wallet validates UserOperations submitted by ERC-4337 bundlers
- The EntryPoint contract calls validateUserOp on behalf of users
- Signature validation confirms the operation was authorized by wallet owners
- Static signatures can be pre-authorized for specific callers
- Supports gasless transactions through bundler-paid execution
