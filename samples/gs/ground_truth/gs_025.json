  "description": "EMERGENCY_ROLE in PositionManager can transfer aWETH from the contract to any address without restrictions, which may be unintended and creates additional risks in case this role is compromised. The emergencyTokenTransfer function allows unrestricted transfer of any ERC20 token, including aWETH which represents the protocol's position in Aave.",

The emergencyTokenTransfer function allows unrestricted transfer of any ERC20 token, including aWETH which represents the protocol's position in Aave.",
  "attack_scenario": "1. Attacker compromises the account holding EMERGENCY_ROLE\n2. Attacker calls emergencyTokenTransfer(aWETH, attackerAddress, aWETH.balanceOf(positionManager))\n3. All aWETH tokens (representing ETH deposited in Aave) are transferred to the attacker\n4. Protocol loses all funds deposited through this position manager\n5. The attack bypasses the normal withdraw() flow which goes through LiquidityBuffer",
  "fix_description": "Disallow aWETH emergency transfers or approvals from the PositionManager contract, since withdrawals are already handled via the more transparent withdraw() flow. The team acknowledged this is intentional for rapid fund withdrawal in critical situations and noted EMERGENCY_ROLE will not be configured at launch.",
