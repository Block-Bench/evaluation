  "description": "The MinVotingPowerCondition contract allows any users who hold at least plugin.minProposerVotingPower() amount of tokens (locked in the LockManager or in their token balance) to create a proposal and execute LockToVote.createProposal. This logic can be easily bypassed if the token allows flashloan or flashmint. Given that isGranted checks the user's token balance (line 45: token.balanceOf(_who) + lockManager.getLockedBalance(_who)), the user does not even need to lock the flashloaned amount into the LockManager to be able to create and spam proposals.",

  "attack_scenario": "1. Flashloan the token.\n2. Create the proposal (isGranted passes because token.balanceOf includes flashloaned amount).\n3. Lock + vote the proposal and auto-execute it (EarlyExecution).\n4. Unlock the tokens.\n5. Repay the flashloan.\nAll in the very same transaction.",
  "fix_description": "Avoid using the token's balance and require the user to only use the locked amount. Change line 45 from 'token.balanceOf(_who) + lockManager.getLockedBalance(_who)' to just 'lockManager.getLockedBalance(_who)'. Store the proposal's creator in the proposal struct and require that the locked amount required to create the proposal won't be unlockable until the proposal ends.",
