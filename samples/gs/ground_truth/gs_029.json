Session signatures are validated per-call using individual call hashes, enabling partial replay. Frontrunners can execute subsets of calls to grief or cause financial loss.",

Attack: Replay [A, B] with [SigA, SigB]. PoC: File POC.t.sol with test testSubmissionValidity. It builds a 2-call payload, expects revert on second call, then replays partial payload successfully.",
