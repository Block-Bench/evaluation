  "attack_scenario": "1. Configurator sets up phantom token A tracking output token USDC via setTokenAllowedStatusBatch()\n2. phantomTokenToOutputToken[phantomA] = USDC\n3. User makes a redemption request for output token USDT (different from USDC)\n4. pendingRedemptions records the request with tokenOut = USDT\n5. User calls withdrawPhantomToken(phantomA, amount)\n6. Function checks: phantomTokenToOutputToken[phantomA] != address(0) -> passes (it's USDC)\n7. Function calls _withdraw(amount) which executes Gateway.withdraw()\n8. Gateway.withdraw() transfers USDT (the actual redemption output) not USDC\n9. The phantom token (tracking USDC) and actual withdrawal (USDT) are mismatched\n10. Integration receives unexpected token, potentially causing accounting errors or failed operations",

  "notes": "The withdrawPhantomToken function accepts a phantom token address and checks that it's registered in phantomTokenToOutputToken mapping. However, it doesn't verify that the pending redemption in the Gateway was actually made for the same output token that the phantom token tracks. The Gateway's withdraw() function will transfer whatever tokenOut was specified in the original redeemRequest(), which may differ from phantomTokenToOutputToken[token].",
