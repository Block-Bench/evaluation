  "description": "The isProposalOpen() function returns true if a proposal is open for voting. It returns false if it's too late OR too early for voting.

Line 226: knownProposalIds.remove(_proposalId) - proposal removed from tracking.\n6. Proposal starts a week later, user votes.\n7. User calls unlock() again - vote isn't cleared because proposal isn't tracked.\n8. User withdraws tokens while still having active votes.",
