Expert-Judge Agreement (n=116 samples):
  Target Detection: κ=0.84, 92% agreement
  Vulnerability Type: κ=0.23
  Overall Correlation: ρ=0.85

Note: Two independent experts reviewed different models:
  - Expert 1 (D4n13l): 80 samples (Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini)
  - Expert 2 (FrontRunner): 36 samples (GPT, Grok, Llama)
  - Sample overlap: 11 samples

Interpretation: κ=0.00 indicates perfect agreement but no variance (all samples vulnerable).
