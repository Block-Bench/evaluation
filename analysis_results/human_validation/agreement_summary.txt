Expert-Judge Agreement (n=46 samples):
  Target Detection: κ=0.00, 80% agreement
  Vulnerability Type: κ=0.35
  Overall Correlation: ρ=N/A

Note: Two independent experts reviewed different models:
  - Expert 1 (D4n13l): 32 samples (Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini)
  - Expert 2 (FrontRunner): 14 samples (GPT, Grok, Llama)
  - Sample overlap: 6 samples

Interpretation: κ=0.00 indicates perfect agreement but no variance (all samples vulnerable).
