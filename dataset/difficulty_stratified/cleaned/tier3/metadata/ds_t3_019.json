  "description": "The NEW_YEARS_GIFT contract allows setting a hash-based password to claim funds via GetGift(). However, the SetPass function can be called again when hashPass==0x0, even after a password is set. The sender can front-run any GetGift transaction by resetting the hashPass, preventing the caller from claiming the funds.",
