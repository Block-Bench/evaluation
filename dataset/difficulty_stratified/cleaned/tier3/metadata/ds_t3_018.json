  "description": "The CEOThrone contract declares its own 'owner' variable which shadows the parent Ownable contract's 'owner'. When Stake() assigns owner = msg.sender, it only updates the child contract's owner variable. The onlyOwner modifier checks the parent Ownable's owner, which remains set to the original deployer, so only the deployer can call withdraw().",
