  "description": "The contract is affected by CVE-2022-38217, this could lead to the early disclosure of metadata of all NFTs in the project. As a result, one can find out valuable NFTs and then target mint of specific NFTs by monitoring mempool and sell the NFTs for a profit in secondary market. The issue is the metadata should be visible after the minting is completed.",
