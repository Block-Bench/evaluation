  "description": "The OpenAddressLottery contract uses an uninitialized storage pointer in forceReseed(). The struct 'SeedComponents s' points to storage slot 0 by default, allowing the owner to overwrite critical storage variables including secretSeed. The owner can manipulate the seed to ensure no participant's lucky number equals 7, preventing any legitimate wins.",
