Given that all data stored on-chain, whether public or private, can be read, it is possible to read private data from the Vault contract by predicting the memory slot where the private data resides.\n\nIf the Vault contract is utilized in a production environment, malicious actors could employ similar techniques to access sensitive information such as user passwords.",
