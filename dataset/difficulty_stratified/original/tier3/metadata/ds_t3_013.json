  "description": "This demonstrates the difference between using 'return' and 'break' in nested loop iterations.\nWhen removing multiple banks from a list, using 'return' in the BuggyBankManager will prematurely exit the function\nafter removing only the first bank, leaving other banks untouched.\nIn contrast, the FixedBankManager uses 'break' correctly to only exit the current inner loop iteration,\nallowing the outer loop to continue processing other banks.\n\nThis is similar to a real bug where a function intended to allow the removal of multiple DEXes approved for swaps,\nbut would only remove the first DEX because 'return' was used instead of 'break' in the inner for loop.",
