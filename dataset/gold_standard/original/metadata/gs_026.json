  "description": "Staking.totalControlled() derives the mETH/ETH exchange rate inputs from oracle.latestRecord() without validating the record timestamp. If the oracle lags significant state changes (e.g., validator rewards or slashing), the resulting rate becomes stale. An attacker can exploit this by timing mint/burn operations against outdated totals: redeeming mETH for excess ETH when a slashing is not yet reflected (overstated totalControlled()), or depositing ETH to mint excess mETH when recent rewards are not yet reflected (understated totalControlled()), extracting value from other users.",

Oracle has not yet updated to reflect the new rewards\n3. totalControlled() returns the old (lower) value\n4. Attacker calls stake() and receives more mETH per ETH than they should\n5.
