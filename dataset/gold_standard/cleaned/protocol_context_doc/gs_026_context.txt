PROTOCOL CONTEXT: Mantle - Staking Oracle (mETH)

PROTOCOL TYPE: Liquid Staking / Price Oracle

OVERVIEW:
The Mantle Staking contract uses an oracle to determine the mETH/ETH exchange rate. The oracle reports the total ETH controlled by the protocol including validator balances, which determines how much ETH each mETH token can be redeemed for.

BUSINESS MODEL:
- Oracle reports total ETH controlled by the protocol (validators + reserves)
- Exchange rate is calculated from total ETH divided by mETH supply
- Rate updates when validators earn rewards (increases) or get slashed (decreases)
- Minting and redemption use the current exchange rate
- Oracle updates are typically done off-chain and submitted by authorized reporters
