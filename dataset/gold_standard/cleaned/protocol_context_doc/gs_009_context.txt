PROTOCOL CONTEXT: Hybra Finance - VotingEscrow

PROTOCOL TYPE: Vote Escrow / Time-Locked Governance

OVERVIEW:
VotingEscrow is the core locking mechanism that converts tokens into vote-escrowed NFTs (veNFTs). Users lock tokens for a duration to receive voting power that decays linearly over time. Longer locks provide more voting power, incentivizing long-term protocol alignment.

BUSINESS MODEL:
- Users lock tokens for a chosen duration (up to a maximum period) to receive a veNFT
- Voting power is proportional to locked amount and remaining lock time
- Users can increase their locked amount or extend their lock duration
- veNFTs can be used for governance voting and earning protocol rewards
- Checkpoints track voting power changes over time for historical queries
