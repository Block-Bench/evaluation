PROTOCOL CONTEXT: Hybra Finance - GaugeCL

PROTOCOL TYPE: Concentrated Liquidity Gauge / Reward Distribution

OVERVIEW:
GaugeCL is a gauge contract designed for concentrated liquidity positions. It handles reward distribution to liquidity providers in CL pools, with support for epoch-based reward periods and rollover of undistributed rewards to subsequent epochs.

BUSINESS MODEL:
- Liquidity providers in concentrated liquidity pools stake their positions to earn rewards
- Rewards are distributed over epochs based on liquidity provision
- Undistributed rewards from one epoch can roll over to the next
- The reward rate determines how quickly rewards are distributed within each epoch
- Protocol notifies the gauge of new reward amounts to initiate distribution
