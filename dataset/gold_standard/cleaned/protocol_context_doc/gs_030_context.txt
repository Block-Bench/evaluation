PROTOCOL CONTEXT: Sequence - Session Signature Management

PROTOCOL TYPE: Smart Contract Wallet / Session Keys

OVERVIEW:
Sequence supports session keys that allow delegating wallet operations to temporary keys with limited permissions. SessionSig handles the hashing and validation of session-based signatures, enabling users to grant time-limited access to their wallet for specific operations.

BUSINESS MODEL:
- Wallet owners can create sessions with limited permissions
- Session keys can sign transactions on behalf of the wallet
- Sessions include replay protection via nonces and expiry times
- Session signatures are validated against the wallet's configuration
- Allows delegating access without sharing the main wallet keys
