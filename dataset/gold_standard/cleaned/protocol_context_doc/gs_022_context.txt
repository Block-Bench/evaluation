PROTOCOL CONTEXT: Mantle - LiquidityBuffer (mETH x Aave)

PROTOCOL TYPE: Liquid Staking / Yield Optimization

OVERVIEW:
LiquidityBuffer is part of the Mantle mETH liquid staking protocol's integration with Aave. It manages ETH liquidity between the staking protocol and yield-generating position managers (like Aave). It handles auto-allocation of deposits, tracks controlled balances, and manages position manager lifecycle.

BUSINESS MODEL:
- Receives ETH deposits from the main staking contract
- Auto-allocates funds to a default position manager when enabled
- Tracks total ETH controlled across multiple position managers
- Position managers can be activated/deactivated by administrators
- Supports withdrawal of funds from position managers back to the buffer
