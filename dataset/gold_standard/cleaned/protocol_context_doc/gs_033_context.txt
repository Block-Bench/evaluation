PROTOCOL CONTEXT: Sequence - Wallet Factory

PROTOCOL TYPE: Smart Contract Wallet / Deployment

OVERVIEW:
The Sequence Factory deploys new smart contract wallets using CREATE2 for deterministic addresses. Users can predict their wallet address before deployment, enabling receiving funds before the wallet exists. The factory is essential for ERC-4337 compatibility.

BUSINESS MODEL:
- Deploys new Sequence wallets with deterministic addresses via CREATE2
- Wallet address is derived from the initial configuration (image hash)
- Users can receive funds at their wallet address before deployment
- ERC-4337 bundlers use the factory to deploy wallets on first use
- Supports counterfactual wallet deployment for gasless onboarding
