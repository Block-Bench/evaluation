PROTOCOL CONTEXT: Sequence - Smart Wallet Call Execution

PROTOCOL TYPE: Smart Contract Wallet / Account Abstraction

OVERVIEW:
Sequence smart wallets execute batches of calls on behalf of their owners. The Calls module handles execution of multiple operations in a single transaction, with configurable behavior for handling failures. It supports session-based authorization for delegated execution.

BUSINESS MODEL:
- Wallet owners sign batches of calls to be executed
- Calls can be configured to revert on failure or continue
- Session signatures allow delegating specific operations to other keys
- Nonces prevent replay of executed transactions
- Multiple calls can be bundled and executed atomically
