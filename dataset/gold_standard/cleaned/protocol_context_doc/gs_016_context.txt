PROTOCOL CONTEXT: Aragon - MinVotingPowerCondition

PROTOCOL TYPE: DAO Governance / Access Control

OVERVIEW:
MinVotingPowerCondition is a permission condition contract that gates who can create proposals in the Lock-to-Vote system. It checks whether a user has sufficient voting power (either locked or in their wallet) to create proposals, preventing spam and ensuring meaningful participation.

BUSINESS MODEL:
- Enforces minimum token requirements for proposal creation
- Checks both locked token balance and wallet balance
- Acts as a gatekeeper for the createProposal permission
- Integrates with Aragon's permission system
- Configured with a minimum voting power threshold by DAO administrators
