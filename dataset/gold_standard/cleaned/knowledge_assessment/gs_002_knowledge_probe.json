When was this audit published? (year and month)\n2. What is the title or summary of this finding?\n3. What type of vulnerability was identified?\n4. Can you briefly describe the vulnerability and its impact?\n5. What was the recommended fix?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific audit finding, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific audit finding.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about from your training data.",
