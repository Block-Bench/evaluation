All aWETH tokens (representing ETH deposited in Aave) are transferred to the attacker\n4. Protocol loses all funds deposited through this position manager\n5. The attack bypasses the normal withdraw() flow which goes through LiquidityBuffer",

  "fix_description": "Disallow aWETH emergency transfers or approvals from the PositionManager contract, since withdrawals are already handled via the more transparent withdraw() flow. The team acknowledged this is intentional for rapid fund withdrawal in critical situations and noted EMERGENCY_ROLE will not be configured at launch.",
