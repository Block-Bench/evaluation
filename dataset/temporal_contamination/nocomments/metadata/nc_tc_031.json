  "description": "Orbit Chain bridge suffered an $81M exploit when attackers compromised validator private keys and used them to forge signatures authorizing fraudulent cross-chain withdrawals. The bridge's multi-sig system (5-of-7) was bypassed through key compromise rather than smart contract vulnerabilities.",

    "root_cause": "Compromised validator private keys enabled signature forgery",

      "Insufficient validator key security",

    "Attackers compromise 5 of 7 validator private keys through phishing or malware",

  "mitigation": [
    "Implement hardware security modules (HSMs) for validator keys",
