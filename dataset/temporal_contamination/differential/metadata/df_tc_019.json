  "root_cause": "The bridge handler did not validate that the token contract address was not zero. Calls to address(0) do not revert in the EVM, so the transferFrom call succeeded silently without moving any tokens. However, the deposit event was still emitted, causing the destination chain to mint unbacked tokens.",
