  "description": "Flash loan attack manipulating Curve pool to inflate virtual_price. The earn function trusted Curve's spot price which was temporarily inflated through imbalanced liquidity, causing vault to overvalue its position.",
  "root_cause": "Using manipulable spot price from Curve pool (get_virtual_price) for vault strategy calculations. Spot prices can be manipulated within single transaction via flash loans that temporarily imbalance AMM pools.",
  "attack_scenario": "Attacker used flash loans to imbalance Curve 3pool, inflating virtual_price. Called vault.earn() which used inflated price. Normalized pool, repeated process multiple times to siphon value. Withdrew with inflated shares.",
