  "description": "Sonne Finance, a Compound V2 fork on Optimism, lost $20M through a donation attack on a low-liquidity market. The attacker deposited minimal tokens, donated large amounts directly to inflate the exchange rate, then used the inflated collateral value to borrow assets far exceeding actual collateral.",

    "root_cause": "Exchange rate calculation vulnerable when totalSupply is very small, allowing donation to manipulate underlying/supply ratio",
