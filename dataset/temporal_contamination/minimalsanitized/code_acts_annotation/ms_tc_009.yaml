  - id: "CA1"
    type: "DECLARATION"
    lines: [19]
    code: "mapping(address => mapping(address => uint256)) public supplied;"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Balance mapping declaration. Storage existence is not the vulnerability - the issue is the ordering of external call vs state update."

  - id: "CA2"
    type: "DECLARATION"
    lines: [20]
    code: "mapping(address => uint256) public totalSupplied;"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Total supply tracking. Updated after external call but not exploitable directly."

  - id: "CA3"
    type: "EXT_CALL"
    lines: [31]
    code: 'require(token.transfer(address(this), amount), "Transfer failed");'
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Transfer in supply() - tokens come FROM user. No reentrancy risk here."

  - id: "CA4"
    type: "STATE_MOD"
    lines: [34, 35]
    code: |
      supplied[msg.sender][asset] += amount;
      totalSupplied[asset] += amount;
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "State updates in supply(). Correctly implemented after transfer from user."

  - id: "CA5"
    type: "DECLARATION"
    lines: [57]
    code: "uint256 userBalance = supplied[msg.sender][asset];"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Caches user balance. This is standard implementation - the vulnerability is in the external call before state update, not in caching."

  - id: "CA6"
    type: "INPUT_VAL"
    lines: [58]
    code: 'require(userBalance > 0, "No balance");'
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Balance check. Correctly implemented - it's a consequence of the CEI violation, not the cause."

  - id: "CA7"
    type: "COMPUTATION"
    lines: [61, 62, 63, 64]
    code: |
      uint256 withdrawAmount = requestedAmount;
      if (requestedAmount == type(uint256).max) {
          withdrawAmount = userBalance;
      }
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Withdrawal amount calculation. Correctly handles max value case."

  - id: "CA8"
    type: "INPUT_VAL"
    lines: [65]
    code: 'require(withdrawAmount <= userBalance, "Insufficient balance");'
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Balance check. Correctly implemented - it's a consequence of the CEI violation, not the cause."

  - id: "CA9"
    type: "EXT_CALL"
    lines: [68]
    code: "IERC777(asset).transfer(msg.sender, withdrawAmount);"
    security_function: "ROOT_CAUSE"
    rationale: "ROOT_CAUSE - ERC-777 transfer triggers tokensToSend callback on recipient. Attacker can reenter withdraw() before state update. Classic checks-effects-interactions violation."

  - id: "CA10"
    type: "STATE_MOD"
    lines: [71, 72]
    code: |
      supplied[msg.sender][asset] -= withdrawAmount;
      totalSupplied[asset] -= withdrawAmount;
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "State updates that reduce balance. The operation is correct - it's just in the wrong order (after external call). The root cause is CA9."

  - id: "CA11"
    type: "CTRL_FLOW"
    lines: [74]
    code: "return withdrawAmount;"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Return statement."

  - id: "CA12"
    type: "CTRL_FLOW"
    lines: [84]
    code: "return supplied[user][asset];"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "View function return. No security impact."
