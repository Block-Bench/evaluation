    code: |
      (bool success, bytes memory result) = routeAddress.call(routeData);
      require(success, "Route execution failed");
    security_function: "ROOT_CAUSE"
    rationale: "ROOT_CAUSE - Gateway executes arbitrary call to route with user-controlled routeData. Attacker can forward malicious calldata to drain approved tokens."

  - id: "CA2"
    type: "EXT_CALL"
    lines: [71, 72]
    code: |
      (bool success, ) = fromToken.call(swapExtraData);
      require(success, "Swap failed");
    security_function: "ROOT_CAUSE"
    rationale: "ROOT_CAUSE - Route executes arbitrary call with user-controlled swapExtraData. Attacker injects transferFrom() to drain tokens from users who approved the gateway."

  - id: "CA3"

    lines: [33, 34, 35]
    code: |
      address routeAddress = routes[routeId];
      require(routeAddress != address(0), "Invalid route");
      require(approvedRoutes[routeAddress], "Route not approved");
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Route validation. The route is legitimately approved - the vulnerability is data-level, not route-level."

    type: "CTRL_FLOW"
    lines: [69, 73]
    code: "if (swapExtraData.length > 0) { ... }"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Control flow condition. Standard branching logic, not a vulnerability enabler."

  - id: "CA5"

    lines: [42, 43]
    code: |
      emit RouteExecuted(routeId, msg.sender, result);

    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Event emission and return."

    code: |

    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Route registration (simplified, missing access control)."

  - id: "CA7"
