    code: "uint256 collateralPrice = oracle.getAssetPrice(msg.sender);"
    security_function: "ROOT_CAUSE"
    rationale: "ROOT_CAUSE - Fetches collateral price from manipulable Curve pool oracle. Attacker drains pool liquidity to inflate reported price, deposits at inflated value."

    code: "uint256 price = (balance1 * 1e18) / balance0;"
    security_function: "ROOT_CAUSE"
    rationale: "ROOT_CAUSE - Price calculation uses spot balances from Curve pool. Large swaps can manipulate balance0/balance1 ratio to inflate or deflate price."

    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Balance reads within oracle. Implementation detail of CA2 - the vulnerability is the price formula, not the reads themselves."
