  - id: "CA1"
    type: "DECLARATION"
    lines: [11]
    code: "address public underlying; // Old TUSD address"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Variable declaration. Storage existence is not a vulnerability - the bug is in how it's initialized."

  - id: "CA2"
    type: "DECLARATION"
    lines: [18, 19]
    code: |
      address public constant OLD_TUSD =
          0x8dd5fbCe2F6a956C3022bA3663759011Dd51e73E;
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Constant declaration. Constants are contextual data, not exploit prerequisites."

  - id: "CA3"
    type: "DECLARATION"
    lines: [20, 21]
    code: |
      address public constant NEW_TUSD =
          0x0000000000085d4780B73119b644AE5ecd22b376;
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Constant declaration. Constants are contextual data, not exploit prerequisites."

  - id: "CA4"
    type: "INITIALIZATION"
    lines: [23, 24, 25, 26]
    code: |
      constructor() {
          admin = msg.sender;
          underlying = OLD_TUSD;
      }
    security_function: "ROOT_CAUSE"
    rationale: "ROOT_CAUSE - Sets underlying to OLD_TUSD. This is the logic error - the variable used for sweep protection points to the old token, not the new token that the contract actually uses."

  - id: "CA5"
    type: "EXT_CALL"
    lines: [32]
    code: "IERC20(NEW_TUSD).transfer(address(this), amount);"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Mint token transfer. Contextual usage showing NEW_TUSD is the actual token, but this does not enable the exploit."

  - id: "CA6"
    type: "STATE_MOD"
    lines: [33, 34]
    code: |
      accountTokens[msg.sender] += amount;
      totalSupply += amount;
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Mint state updates. Correctly tracks tokens."

  - id: "CA7"
    type: "INPUT_VAL"
    lines: [39]
    code: 'require(token != underlying, "Cannot sweep underlying token");'
    security_function: "INSUFF_GUARD"
    rationale: "INSUFF_GUARD - The guard attempts to protect against sweeping the underlying token but fails because it checks against `underlying` which was initialized with the wrong value (OLD_TUSD instead of NEW_TUSD). The guard logic is semantically correct but depends on corrupted state, making it an insufficient protection."

  - id: "CA8"
    type: "EXT_CALL"
    lines: [42, 43]
    code: |
      uint256 balance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
      IERC20(token).transfer(msg.sender, balance);
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Sweep transfer execution. This is the exploit payoff action, not a prerequisite. Prerequisites must exist before exploitation; this is the effect."

  - id: "CA9"
    type: "INPUT_VAL"
    lines: [50]
    code: 'require(accountTokens[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");'
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Redeem balance check. Correctly validates user balance."

  - id: "CA10"
    type: "STATE_MOD"
    lines: [52, 53]
    code: |
      accountTokens[msg.sender] -= amount;
      totalSupply -= amount;
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Redeem state updates. Correctly decrements balances."

  - id: "CA11"
    type: "EXT_CALL"
    lines: [55]
    code: "IERC20(NEW_TUSD).transfer(msg.sender, amount);"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Redeem token transfer. Redemption logic is orthogonal to the sweep exploit."
