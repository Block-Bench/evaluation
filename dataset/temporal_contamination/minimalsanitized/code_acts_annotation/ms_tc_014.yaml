  # SECURITY-RELEVANT CODE ACTS (detailed)
  # ============================================

  - id: "CA1"
    type: "DECLARATION"
    lines: [23]
    code: "address public governance;"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Governance variable declaration. Not a prerequisite - governance is unused in the vulnerable function."

  - id: "CA2"
    type: "DECLARATION"
    lines: [24]
    code: "mapping(address => address) public strategies;"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Strategy mapping. Not directly vulnerable."

  - id: "CA3"
    type: "INITIALIZATION"
    lines: [26, 27, 28]
    code: |
      constructor() {
          governance = msg.sender;
      }
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Sets governance. Correctly implemented."

  - id: "CA4"
    type: "INPUT_VAL"
    lines: [38]
    code: 'require(_targets.length == _data.length, "Length mismatch");'
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Array length validation. Correctly checks alignment."

  - id: "CA5"
    type: "CTRL_FLOW"
    lines: [40]
    code: "for (uint256 i = 0; i < _targets.length; i++) {"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Loop over targets array. This is an amplifier, not a prerequisite - a single unchecked call is already sufficient to exploit."

  - id: "CA6"
    type: "EXT_CALL"
    lines: [41, 42]
    code: |
      (bool success, ) = _targets[i].call(_data[i]);
      require(success, "Call failed");
    security_function: "ROOT_CAUSE"
    rationale: "ROOT_CAUSE - Arbitrary external call with attacker-controlled target and data. No access control check - anyone can call this function and execute arbitrary contract calls. Attacker can drain funds by calling token.transfer() or approve()."

  - id: "CA7"
    type: "ACCESS_CTRL"
    lines: [52, 53, 54, 55]
    code: |
      function setStrategy(address jar, address strategy) external {
          require(msg.sender == governance, "Not governance");
          strategies[jar] = strategy;
      }
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "setStrategy has correct access control. Shows that governance check exists but was not applied to swapExactJarForJar."

  - id: "CA8"
    type: "DECLARATION"
    lines: [59, 60]
    code: |
      address public controller;
      address public want;
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "PickleStrategy state variables. Not directly vulnerable."

  - id: "CA9"
    type: "INITIALIZATION"
    lines: [62, 63, 64, 65]
    code: |
      constructor(address _controller, address _want) {
          controller = _controller;
          want = _want;
      }
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Strategy constructor. Correctly sets addresses."

  - id: "CA10"
    type: "EXT_CALL"
    lines: [74, 75]
    code: |
      uint256 balance = IERC20(want).balanceOf(address(this));
      IERC20(want).transfer(controller, balance);
    security_function: "SECONDARY_VULN"
    rationale: "SECONDARY_VULN - withdrawAll lacks access control. Anyone can call and send funds to controller. Different vulnerability from the main swapExactJarForJar issue."

  - id: "CA11"
    type: "EXT_CALL"
    lines: [83, 84]
    code: |
      uint256 balance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
      IERC20(token).transfer(controller, balance);
    security_function: "SECONDARY_VULN"
    rationale: "SECONDARY_VULN - withdraw(token) also lacks access control. Anyone can withdraw any token to controller."
