  # ============================================

  - id: "CA1"
    type: "DECLARATION"
    lines: [17, 18]
    code: |
      mapping(address => uint256) public accountBorrows;
      mapping(address => uint256) public accountTokens;
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Storage mapping declarations. The existence of mappings doesn't enable reentrancy."

  - id: "CA2"
    type: "DECLARATION"
    lines: [20, 21]
    code: |
      address public underlying;
      uint256 public totalBorrows;
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Underlying token address and total borrows tracking."

  - id: "CA3"
    type: "INITIALIZATION"
    lines: [23, 24, 25]
    code: |
      constructor(address _underlying) {
          underlying = _underlying;
      }
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Constructor sets underlying token. Correctly implemented."

  - id: "CA4"
    type: "STATE_MOD"
    lines: [28, 29]
    code: |
      accountBorrows[msg.sender] += amount;
      totalBorrows += amount;
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "State updates before external call. This follows CEI pattern correctly - the vulnerability is missing reentrancy guard, not the order of operations."

  - id: "CA5"
    type: "EXT_CALL"
    lines: [32]
    code: "IERC20(underlying).transfer(msg.sender, amount);"
    security_function: "ROOT_CAUSE"
    rationale: "ROOT_CAUSE - Token transfer to borrower. If underlying is ERC667/ERC777 with transfer hooks, recipient can reenter borrow() before this call returns. Each reentry executes another borrow with same collateral."

  - id: "CA6"
    type: "EXT_CALL"
    lines: [37]
    code: "IERC20(underlying).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Token transfer in repay. Correctly transfers before state update."

  - id: "CA7"
    type: "STATE_MOD"
    lines: [40, 41]
    code: |
      accountBorrows[msg.sender] -= amount;
      totalBorrows -= amount;
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "State updates in repay. Correctly implemented."
