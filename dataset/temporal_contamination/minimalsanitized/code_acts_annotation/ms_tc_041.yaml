    type: "ACCESS_CTRL"
    lines: [43, 44, 45, 46, 49, 55, 56]
    code: |
      function upgradePool(
          address poolProxy,
          address newImplementation
      ) external {
          require(msg.sender == admin, "Not admin");
      }
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Admin-protected upgrade function. The access control is correctly implemented. Single admin vs multi-sig is an architectural/operational choice, not a code bug. The real vulnerability is CA2 (arbitrary call without input validation)."

  - id: "CA2"
    type: "EXT_CALL"
    lines: [82, 83, 84]
    code: |
      (bool success, ) = pair.call(
          abi.encodeWithSignature("claimRewards(address)", msg.sender)
      );
    security_function: "ROOT_CAUSE"
    rationale: "ROOT_CAUSE - Arbitrary external call to user-controlled pair address. Attacker provides malicious pair contract that manipulates balances."

  - id: "CA3"
    type: "DECLARATION"
    lines: [76, 77, 78, 79]
    code: |
      function claimReward(
          address pair,
          uint256[] calldata ids
      ) external override
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Function signature. Accepting user-controlled address is design choice - vulnerability is in CA2's arbitrary call without validation."

    code: |
      constructor() {
          admin = msg.sender;
      }
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Constructor setting admin."

          SmartLoan loan = new SmartLoan();
          return address(loan);
      }
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Standard loan creation function."
