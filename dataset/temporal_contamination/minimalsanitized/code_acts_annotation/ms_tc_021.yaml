  - id: "CA1"
    type: "DECLARATION"
    lines: [26]
    code: "ICurvePool public curvePool;"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Storage variable for Curve pool reference. Correctly declared."

  - id: "CA2"
    type: "INITIALIZATION"
    lines: [28, 29, 30]
    code: |
      constructor(address _curvePool) {
          curvePool = ICurvePool(_curvePool);
      }
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Constructor sets curve pool address. Correctly implemented."

  - id: "CA3"
    type: "EXT_CALL"
    lines: [35]
    code: "return curvePool.get_virtual_price();"
    security_function: "ROOT_CAUSE"
    rationale: "ROOT_CAUSE - Oracle directly returns Curve's get_virtual_price() without any TWAP or manipulation resistance. Flash loan attackers can inflate virtual_price by adding massive liquidity in same transaction."

  - id: "CA4"
    type: "DECLARATION"
    lines: [40, 41, 42, 43]
    code: |
      struct Position {
          uint256 collateral;
          uint256 borrowed;
      }
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Position struct. Correctly defined."

  - id: "CA5"
    type: "DECLARATION"
    lines: [45]
    code: "mapping(address => Position) public positions;"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Position mapping. Correctly implemented."

  - id: "CA6"
    type: "DECLARATION"
    lines: [47, 48, 49]
    code: |
      address public collateralToken;
      address public borrowToken;
      address public oracle;
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Storage declarations for token and oracle addresses. Correctly defined."

  - id: "CA7"
    type: "DECLARATION"
    lines: [51]
    code: "uint256 public constant COLLATERAL_FACTOR = 80;"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "80% collateral factor. Correctly defined constant."

  - id: "CA8"
    type: "INITIALIZATION"
    lines: [53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61]

          collateralToken = _collateralToken;
          borrowToken = _borrowToken;
          oracle = _oracle;
      }
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Constructor initializes token and oracle addresses."

  - id: "CA9"
    type: "EXT_CALL"
    lines: [67]
    code: "IERC20(collateralToken).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Collateral deposit transfer. Correctly implemented."

  - id: "CA10"
    type: "STATE_MOD"
    lines: [68]

    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Collateral balance update. Correctly implemented."

  - id: "CA11"
    type: "CTRL_FLOW"
    lines: [74]
    code: "uint256 collateralValue = getCollateralValue(msg.sender);"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Call to getCollateralValue. The call site is benign - the vulnerability is in the oracle (CA3, CA17)."

  - id: "CA12"
    type: "COMPUTATION"
    lines: [75]
    code: "uint256 maxBorrow = (collateralValue * COLLATERAL_FACTOR) / 100;"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Max borrow calculation. This is downstream impact from the manipulated oracle value."

  - id: "CA13"
    type: "INPUT_VAL"
    lines: [77, 78, 79, 80]
    code: |
      require(
          positions[msg.sender].borrowed + amount <= maxBorrow,
          "Insufficient collateral"
      );
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Borrow limit validation. Correctly implemented - it's the oracle value that's wrong, not this check."

  - id: "CA14"
    type: "STATE_MOD"
    lines: [82]
    code: "positions[msg.sender].borrowed += amount;"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Borrowed amount update. Correctly implemented."

  - id: "CA15"
    type: "EXT_CALL"
    lines: [83]
    code: "IERC20(borrowToken).transfer(msg.sender, amount);"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Token transfer to borrower. Correctly implemented."

  - id: "CA16"
    type: "CTRL_FLOW"
    lines: [90]
    code: "uint256 collateralAmount = positions[user].collateral;"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Reads collateral amount. Correctly implemented."

  - id: "CA17"
    type: "EXT_CALL"
    lines: [91]
    code: "uint256 price = SimplifiedOracle(oracle).getPrice();"
    security_function: "ROOT_CAUSE"
    rationale: "ROOT_CAUSE - Fetches price from manipulable oracle. Flash loan attack inflates virtual_price, causing this to return artificially high value."

  - id: "CA18"
    type: "COMPUTATION"
    lines: [93]
    code: "return (collateralAmount * price) / 1e18;"
    security_function: "BENIGN"
    rationale: "Collateral value calculation. Correctly multiplies collateral by price - the price being wrong is the issue."
