  "description": "Orbit Chain bridge suffered an $81M exploit when attackers compromised validator private keys and used them to forge signatures authorizing fraudulent cross-chain withdrawals. The bridge's multi-sig system (5-of-7) was bypassed through key compromise rather than smart contract vulnerabilities.",
