  "description": "KyberSwap Elastic concentrated liquidity AMM vulnerability involving precision loss and overflow/underflow in liquidity calculations during tick transitions. Attacker manipulated liquidity positions and executed swaps to trigger calculation errors in _addLiquidity() function, causing incorrect liquidity tracking. This allowed extracting more tokens than deposited, draining $47M across multiple chains.",

  "vulnerable_function": "swap, _addLiquidity",
  "vulnerable_lines": [],
  "attack_scenario": "Attacker takes flash loan of large token amounts. Creates strategic liquidity positions at specific ticks designed to cause calculation errors. Executes swaps that trigger multiple tick transitions. During tick crossings, liquidityNet values are retrieved and added to current liquidity using _addLiquidity(). This function lacks overflow/underflow protection, allowing manipulated inputs to cause arithmetic errors. Rounding errors accumulate across multiple tick crossings. Attacker exploits incorrect liquidity state to extract more tokens than entitled. Repeats across multiple pools and chains. Repays flash loans with $47M profit.",
  "root_cause": "Concentrated liquidity AMM requires precise tracking of liquidity at each price tick. When swaps cross ticks, the contract updates active liquidity by adding/subtracting liquidityNet values. The _addLiquidity() function performed unchecked arithmetic operations that could overflow or underflow with carefully crafted inputs. Precision loss in fixed-point arithmetic accumulated across multiple tick transitions. No invariant checks validated liquidity state before/after operations. Complex mathematical operations in concentrated liquidity created exploitable edge cases.",
  "fix_description": "Add overflow/underflow checks to all liquidity arithmetic operations. Use Solidity 0.8+ checked arithmetic or SafeMath library. Implement more precise rounding in liquidity delta calculations. Add invariant checks before and after tick crossings to validate liquidity state. Implement bounds checking on liquidity values. Add comprehensive unit tests for edge cases in tick math. Implement emergency pause mechanism for detecting anomalous pool states. Consider formal verification of critical mathematical operations.",

Affected multiple chains simultaneously (Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Arbitrum, Optimism). Attacker left on-chain message attempting to negotiate for control of KyberSwap in exchange for returning funds. Team rejected demand, most funds not recovered. Demonstrates complexity and risk in concentrated liquidity AMM implementations.",
