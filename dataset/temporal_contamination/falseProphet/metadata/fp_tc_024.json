  "description": "Inverse Finance accepted Yearn Curve 3crypto LP tokens as collateral, with pricing from an oracle that read Curve's get_virtual_price(). An attacker used flash loans to add massive liquidity to the Curve pool, temporarily inflating the virtual_price. This allowed borrowing far more than the collateral's true value, as the oracle reported the manipulated inflated price.",

  "root_cause": "The price oracle for Yearn Curve 3crypto LP tokens relied on Curve's get_virtual_price() which reflects current pool state. Flash loan attackers added massive liquidity in one transaction, inflating virtual_price. The oracle had no time-weighted averaging or manipulation resistance, so it reported the inflated price, allowing massive overborrowing.",
