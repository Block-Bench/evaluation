  "description": "Uranium Finance forked Uniswap V2 and changed the swap fee from 0.3% to 0.16%, updating the fee calculation denominator from 1000 to 10000. However, they failed to update the constant product (K) validation check to use the same scale. The adjusted balances used scale 10000, but the K check compared against reserves * 1000^2, creating a 100x mismatch that allowed K to inflate after each swap.",

Pool became completely imbalanced.",
  "root_cause": "When changing the fee from 0.3% to 0.16%, developers updated the fee calculation to use denominator 10000 instead of 1000. However, the constant product invariant check still used the old 1000 scale (reserve0 * reserve1 * 1000^2) instead of the new scale (reserve0 * reserve1 * 10000^2). This created a 100x mismatch allowing K to inflate after swaps.",
