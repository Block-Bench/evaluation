  "description": "Flash loan attack manipulating Curve pool to inflate virtual_price. The earn function trusted Curve's spot price which was temporarily inflated through imbalanced liquidity, causing vault to overvalue its position.",

  "attack_scenario": "Attacker used flash loans to imbalance Curve 3pool, inflating virtual_price. Called vault.earn() which used inflated price. Normalized pool, repeated process multiple times to siphon value. Withdrew with inflated shares.",
