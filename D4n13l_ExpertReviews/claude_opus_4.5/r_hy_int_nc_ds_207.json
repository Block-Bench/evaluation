Additionally, the transfer direction is backwards - it transfers tokens FROM the buyer TO the owner, when the buyer should be receiving tokens. The buyer pays ETH and also loses tokens instead of receiving them.",
      "classification": "DESIGN_CHOICE",
      "reasoning": "This finding is a design choice or out of scope because the model is interpreting the contract's behavior as intentional rather than a vulnerability.",

      "finding_number": 2,
      "model_claim": "The return value of token.transferFrom() is not checked. ERC20 tokens can return false on failure instead of reverting. If the transfer fails silently, the state (price and owner) is still updated, allowing an attacker to become the owner without any token transfer actually occurring.",
      "classification": "BONUS_VALID",

More critically, combined with the broken buy logic, the owner can manipulate the price freely.",
