The refundAddresses array and refundAmount mapping are private/internal with no setter functions. While this makes the contracts non-functional rather than directly exploitable, it means no funds can ever be properly tracked for refunds, and any ETH sent to these contracts would be permanently locked.",

This means it's looking up refund amounts for addresses 0x0, 0x1, 0x2, etc. (addresses corresponding to the integer index values), not the actual refund addresses stored in the array.",
