While the described scenario is technically possible, it requires the manager role to be compromised and does not present a concrete exploit path without additional assumptions. The window of vulnerability is minimal and requires specific timing, making it more of a theoretical concern than a practical vulnerability. Additionally, the impact is limited as it still requires the old buffer to act maliciously during a very short timeframe."
