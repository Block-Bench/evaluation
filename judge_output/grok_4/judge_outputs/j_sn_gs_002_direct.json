The issue is related to gas inefficiency and potential transaction reverts due to high gas consumption, which is a known pattern in many protocols. There is a concrete exploit scenario, but the impact is not material as it does not result in loss of funds or unauthorized access. Additionally, the owner can still collect fees using the collectProtocolFees function for individual pools, which mitigates the issue."
