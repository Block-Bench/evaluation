It describes a concrete exploit where an attacker can call setAcceptedRoot to set an arbitrary root, allowing them to validate malicious messages and execute unauthorized actions via bridgeRouter. The exploit does not require a compromised trusted role, there is no existing mitigation, the vulnerability is in scope, it is not a design choice, and it has material impact as it can lead to loss of user funds."
