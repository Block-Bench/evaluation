While `transfer` has a gas limit, if the recipient is a contract, it might trigger fallback logic. More critically, the `_0xbd51e0` function in `_0x1496ea` (addLiquidity) calls `msg.sender.call{value: 0}(\"\")` which is a full-gas external call.",

When swapping from ETH (index 0), the code increments `_0xd3c905[0]` inside the `if (_0x0d5f28 == 0)` block, and then immediately increments `_0xd3c905[_0x0d5f28]` again outside the block. This causes the contract to believe it has more ETH reserves than it actually holds.",
