The function is intended to check the allowance, not the balance, as it is used to determine if the contract is allowed to transfer tokens on behalf of the user. The actual vulnerability related to unchecked return values is not addressed in this finding."

It correctly identifies the use of standard ERC20 transfer functions instead of SafeERC20, which is part of the target vulnerability. However, it does not fully capture the root cause or the exploit scenario related to tokens that do not revert on transfer failure."
