      "description": "The function `_0x3c010b` (which acts as a `batchTransfer`) calculates the total amount of tokens to be deducted from the sender by multiplying the number of receivers (`_0x3a75f6`) by the transfer value (`_0xa5b9f8`). This multiplication uses the standard `*` operator instead of the `SafeMath` library's `mul` function. In Solidity versions prior to 0.8.0, this operation is susceptible to integer overflow. If the result overflows, the `_0x9657ca` variable (total amount) will wrap around to a small number (potentially 0), while the loop subsequently credits the full `_0xa5b9f8` value to each recipient using SafeMath. This allows an attacker to mint vast amounts of tokens while only deducting a negligible amount from their balance.",
