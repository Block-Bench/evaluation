      "description": "The contract uses `send()` to transfer the prize. If the winner is a contract that has a fallback function which consumes more than 2300 gas or throws an exception, the `send()` will fail (return false). While the contract ignores the return value (`bool res`), the game state is reset (`delete players; tot=0;`). This means the winner loses their funds, but the game continues. However, if the winner is a malicious contract that simply reverts, the funds remain stuck in the contract until the owner drains them via `getProfit`. This is a griefing vector where a user loses funds due to contract limitations.",
