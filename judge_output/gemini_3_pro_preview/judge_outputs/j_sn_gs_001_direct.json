      "description": "The `receivePenaltyReward` function is `external` and lacks access control. It allows anyone to call it with an arbitrary `amount`. While it attempts to transfer `HYBR` from `msg.sender`, it calls `IERC20(HYBR).approve(votingEscrow, amount)` and then `deposit_for`. It does NOT transfer tokens from the caller to the contract first. It assumes the contract *already* has the tokens. However, if the contract has idle HYBR, an attacker can call this to lock those tokens prematurely or manipulate the `penalty` state variable.",

It then calculates `remainingAmount` (amount staying in contract) as `veBalance - userAmount - feeAmount`. It uses `IVotingEscrow.multiSplit` to split the main NFT into three: remaining, user, and fee. The issue is that `veBalance` is the *total* balance of the NFT. If `remainingAmount` is very small (dust) or zero (if the last user withdraws), `multiSplit` might fail or behave unexpectedly depending on the VE implementation.",
