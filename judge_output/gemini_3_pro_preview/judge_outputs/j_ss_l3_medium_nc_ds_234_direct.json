If a bet's target blockhash is missing from the cache, the contract refunds the bet amount. However, the cache update function `_0xc22e5a` explicitly skips recording hashes for blocks that are already older than 256 blocks to 'catch up'. An attacker can intentionally wait for a losing bet to become old, trigger the skip, and receive a refund.",
