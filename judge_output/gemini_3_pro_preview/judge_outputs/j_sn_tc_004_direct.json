They can then directly transfer a large amount of underlying tokens to the vault (inflating `totalAssets` without minting shares). This skews the share price calculation `(amount * totalSupply) / totalAssets` for the next user, causing them to mint 0 shares due to rounding down, losing their deposit.",
