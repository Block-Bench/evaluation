If initialize reverts (e.g., invalid sqrtPriceX96), the transaction reverts after deployment, leaving an uninitialized clone at the deterministic address. An attacker can then initialize it, preventing legitimate users from registering the pool as subsequent initializations fail, blocking official pool creation for that token pair and tick spacing.",
