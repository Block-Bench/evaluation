Transfer functions enforce non-zero values and use safe operations. Batch transfer limits recipients to 20 and checks total balance. Access controls are properly implemented via modifiers. No reentrancy, overflow, or unauthorized access paths exist. Fallback reverts unexpected calls. Old Solidity version (0.4.16) but no exploitable issues in code.",
