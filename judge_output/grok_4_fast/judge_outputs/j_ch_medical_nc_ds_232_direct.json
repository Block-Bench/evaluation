No external calls exist, eliminating reentrancy risks. Access controls are properly enforced via onlyOwner. Fixed supply with no minting. Batch transfer multiplication cannot overflow given the supply cap (7e9 * 1e18) and cnt <=20. Fallback reverts. No concrete exploits for unauthorized fund loss, access, or state manipulation found.",
