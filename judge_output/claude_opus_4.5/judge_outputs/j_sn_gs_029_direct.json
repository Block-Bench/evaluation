Key security properties are maintained: ecrecover results are used only for merkle tree construction (not direct authorization), ERC1271 calls verify signatures against known addresses, weight accumulation uses unchecked but cannot overflow due to uint8 weights, and external calls (ERC1271, Sapient) are intentional design features with results properly validated. The library correctly handles signature parsing, merkle tree reconstruction, and checkpoint validation without exploitable vulnerabilities in the code itself.",
