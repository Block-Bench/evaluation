However, if the `LockManager` holds locked tokens on behalf of users (a common pattern), then `token.balanceOf(_who)` wouldn't include locked tokens, and this is correct. But if tokens remain in the user's wallet while 'locked' (just tracked by the manager), this could double-count their balance.",
