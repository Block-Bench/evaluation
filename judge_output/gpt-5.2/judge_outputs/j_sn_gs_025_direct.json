      "description": "initializeV2 is publicly callable and lacks any access control. The first caller after upgrade can permanently set liquidityBuffer to an attacker-controlled contract. totalControlled() trusts liquidityBuffer.getAvailableBalance() and liquidityBuffer.cumulativeDrawdown() to compute the exchange rate used by stake() (ethToMETH) and unstakeRequest() (mETHToETH). A malicious liquidityBuffer can return manipulated values (or revert), enabling exchange-rate manipulation to extract value from other stakers or causing a protocol-wide DoS for stake/unstake.",
