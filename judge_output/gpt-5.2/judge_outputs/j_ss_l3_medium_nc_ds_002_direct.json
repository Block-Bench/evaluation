Because call forwards all remaining gas, a malicious msg.sender contract can execute code in its fallback function and re-enter _0x1c8d67() repeatedly while _0x7855b3[msg.sender] is still non-zero. Each re-entrant call will pass the same balance amount again, allowing the attacker to withdraw more Ether than they deposited, draining Ether that belongs to other depositors.",
