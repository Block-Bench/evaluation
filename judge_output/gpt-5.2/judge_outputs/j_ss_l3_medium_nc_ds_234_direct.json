      "description": "When a bet is settled more than 256 blocks after its target block, the contract can no longer use blockhash(targetBlock) and instead calls _0x44ec67(targetBlock) to fetch a stored 24-bit random value from _0x6dd5da. However, _0x9a8c0e() initializes every element of _0x6dd5da to the constant value 1, and the contract does not ensure that the specific slot corresponding to the bet\u2019s target block has ever been populated with real randomness by _0xc22e5a(). If the slot was never updated, _0x44ec67() will return a deterministic value (either 0x000000 or 0x000001 depending on (targetBlock - _0x72c28a) % 10), which the attacker can predict in advance. Because _0xbac12b() lets the bettor choose the 24-bit guess (_0x9b9af3) arbitrarily, the attacker can set their guess to exactly match this deterministic \u201crandom\u201d value. That makes XOR == 0, yielding 6 matching nibbles and triggering the jackpot branch in _0xa37364(), paying value * 7,000,000.",
