However, this is a design choice as the initialize function is intended to be called only once by a trusted admin. The lack of zero address check does not constitute a real vulnerability as it assumes the admin is trusted and will provide valid addresses. Additionally, the contract uses OpenZeppelin's Initializable pattern, which is a well-known and secure pattern for initializing upgradeable contracts."
