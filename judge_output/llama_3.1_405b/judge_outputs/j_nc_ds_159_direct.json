The contract uses the `send` function, which is not susceptible to reentrancy attacks because it forwards a fixed amount of 2300 gas, which is insufficient for a reentrant call. Additionally, the contract follows a pattern where state changes (resetting the players array and `tot` variable) occur after the send call, but the use of `send` itself prevents reentrancy."
