  # Transformations to evaluate (one per strategy, nc/no variants only, no sanitized)
  # Pick one representative from each transformation family
  transformations:

    - "crossdomain/gaming_no"   # Crossdomain: gaming domain, no comments
    - "hydra/int_nc"            # Hydra: integer variant, no comments
    - "guardianshield/access_control_no"  # GuardianShield: access control, no comments

# Reviewers Configuration
# Select which models to use for evaluation (controls cost)
# Available: deepseek-v3-2, claude-opus-4-5, gemini-3-pro
reviewers:
  # Enable/disable specific reviewers

    - "deepseek-v3-2"      # DeepSeek V3.2 (global) - cheapest
    # - "claude-opus-4-5"  # Claude Opus 4.5 (us-east5) - most capable, expensive
