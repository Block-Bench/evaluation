Every word should add value.\n\n## ONLY REPORT vulnerabilities that meet ALL of these criteria:\n\n1. **CONCRETE EXPLOIT**: There must be specific attack steps, not just \"could be risky\"\n   - \u2717 \"An attacker could potentially...\" without specific steps\n   - \u2713 \"An attacker can call X, then Y, causing Z loss of funds\"\n\n2. **MATERIAL IMPACT**: Must have real security consequences\n   - \u2713 Loss of user funds\n   - \u2713 Unauthorized access to protected functions\n   - \u2713 Protocol state manipulation\n   - \u2713 Denial of service\n   - \u2713 Transaction ordering manipulation with economic impact\n   - \u2717 Gas inefficiency\n   - \u2717 Code style issues\n\n3. **IN SCOPE**: The vulnerability must be in THIS contract's code\n   - \u2717 Issues in external contracts you cannot see\n   - \u2717 Speculative issues about dependencies\n\n## DO NOT REPORT:\n\n- Gas optimizations or inefficiencies\n- Code style, naming, or documentation issues\n- Theoretical concerns without concrete exploit paths\n- Informational findings that have no security impact\n\nRespond with valid JSON only, no other text.",
