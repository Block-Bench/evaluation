  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Rari Capital Fuse\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "I am familiar with the Rari Capital Fuse incident.\n\nHere are the answers to your questions:\n\n1. The incident occurred in 2022, specifically on April 30, 2022 (also known as the \"Rari Capital hack\" or \"Fuse hack\").\n2. The approximate financial impact was around $80 million USD.\n3. The type of vulnerability exploited was related to an \"oracle manipulation\" or more specifically, a \"price oracle attack\".\n4. The attack worked by manipulating the price oracle used by the Fuse protocol, allowing the attacker to artificially inflate the price of certain assets and then borrow other assets against the manipulated collateral.\n5. The root cause of the vulnerability was related to the protocol's reliance on a vulnerable price oracle (specifically, the \"ElasticInterestRateModel\" and \"CErc20Delegator\" contracts), which was not properly secured against manipulation.\n\nPlease let me know if you need further clarification or details.",
