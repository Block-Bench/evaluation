  "response": "I am familiar with the \"Uranium Finance AMM Miscalculation\" incident on Binance Smart Chain. Here's the information I have:\n\n1. The incident occurred in 2021, specifically in April.\n2. The approximate financial impact was around $50 million USD.\n3. The type of vulnerability exploited was related to a miscalculation or an arithmetic issue in the Automated Market Maker (AMM) contract.\n4. The attack worked by exploiting a vulnerability in the Uranium Finance protocol's AMM contract, which led to a miscalculation of the liquidity pool's assets. This allowed the attacker to drain the pool.\n5. The root cause of the vulnerability was an incorrect implementation or a miscalculation in the AMM's formula, which was not properly handling certain edge cases or input values.\n\nPlease let me know if the information I provided is accurate or if I need to be assessed further.",
