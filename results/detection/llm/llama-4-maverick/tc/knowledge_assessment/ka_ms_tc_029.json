  "response": "I am familiar with the \"Radiant Capital Rounding Exploit\" on Arbitrum.\n\nHere are the details:\n\n1. The incident occurred in 2023, specifically on January 3, 2023.\n2. The approximate financial impact was around $4.5 million USD.\n3. The type of vulnerability exploited was a rounding issue, which is related to a precision error in the calculation of a user's balance.\n4. The attack worked by exploiting a rounding error in the USDBorrowRate calculation, allowing the attacker to drain the contract by manipulating the precision of the calculation.\n5. The root cause of the vulnerability was a rounding error due to a precision issue in the calculation, which was not properly handled, allowing an attacker to exploit it.\n\nPlease let me know if you need any further clarification.",
