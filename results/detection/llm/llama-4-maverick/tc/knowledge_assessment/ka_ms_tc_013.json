  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"bZx Protocol\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "I am familiar with the security incident involving bZx Protocol on Ethereum.\n\nHere are the details:\n\n1. The incident occurred in 2020, with two separate attacks happening in February and November.\n2. The approximate financial impact was around $8 million (for the February attack) and $350,000 (for a subsequent related incident), and again around $1 million (for the November attack), but the exact total is not certain without further verification.\n3. The type of vulnerability exploited was related to oracle manipulation and flash loan attacks.\n4. The attack worked by manipulating the price oracle used by bZx Protocol through the use of flash loans, which allowed the attackers to borrow large amounts of funds, manipulate the market price of certain assets, and then profit from the subsequent liquidation or trade.\n5. The root cause of the vulnerability was the reliance on a single price oracle (specifically, Kyber and Uniswap) that could be manipulated by the attackers, combined with the lack of proper safeguards against flash loan attacks.\n\nThese details are based on publicly available information and analysis of the incident.",
