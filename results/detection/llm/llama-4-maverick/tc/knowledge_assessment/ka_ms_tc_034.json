When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "I am familiar with the \"UwU Lend Oracle Manipulation\" incident.\n\nHere are the details:\n\n1. The incident occurred in June 2023.\n2. The approximate financial impact was around $20 million USD.\n3. The type of vulnerability exploited was oracle manipulation.\n4. The attack worked by manipulating the oracle price feed used by UwU Lend, allowing the attacker to artificially inflate the price of a specific asset and then borrow against it, resulting in a significant loss.\n5. The root cause of the vulnerability was the reliance on a single, manipulable oracle price feed, which was not sufficiently secured or decentralized, allowing an attacker to manipulate the price feed and exploit the protocol.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points.",
