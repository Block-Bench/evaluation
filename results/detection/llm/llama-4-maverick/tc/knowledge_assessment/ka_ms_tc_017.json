(e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "I am familiar with the Warp Finance LP Token Price Manipulation incident.\n\nHere are the details:\n\n1. The incident occurred in December 2020.\n2. The approximate financial impact was around $7.8 million USD.\n3. The type of vulnerability exploited was oracle manipulation, specifically related to the price of LP tokens.\n4. The attack worked by manipulating the price of the LP tokens used as collateral, allowing the attacker to drain the protocol's funds.\n5. The root cause of the vulnerability was the reliance on a single, manipulable price oracle, which allowed the attacker to artificially inflate the price of the LP tokens.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points.",
