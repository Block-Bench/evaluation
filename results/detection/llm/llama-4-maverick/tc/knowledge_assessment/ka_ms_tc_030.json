When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "I am familiar with the security incident related to \"Socket Gateway Route Manipulation\" on Ethereum.\n\nHere are the answers to your questions:\n\n1. The incident occurred in 2024, specifically around late January or early February.\n2. The approximate financial impact was around $3.3 million USD.\n3. The type of vulnerability exploited was related to access control or more specifically, an issue with route validation.\n4. The attack worked by manipulating the route used for bridging assets through Socket's gateway, allowing the attacker to redirect funds to their own address.\n5. The root cause of the vulnerability was related to improper validation or incorrect configuration of the routes used by Socket's gateway, which allowed an attacker to manipulate the transaction flow.\n\nPlease let me know if you need further clarification or details.",
