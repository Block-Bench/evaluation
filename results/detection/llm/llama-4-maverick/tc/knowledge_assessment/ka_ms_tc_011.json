  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"PancakeHunny (PancakeBunny)\" on bsc?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "I am familiar with the security incident involving PancakeBunny (also related to PancakeHunny, though the primary incident is associated with PancakeBunny) on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC).\n\n1. The incident occurred in 2021, specifically around May.\n   \n2. The approximate financial impact was around $45 million USD.\n\n3. The type of vulnerability exploited was related to oracle manipulation, specifically a price oracle manipulation attack.\n\n4. The attack worked by manipulating the price oracle used by PancakeBunny to value its assets. The attacker used flash loans to artificially alter the price of certain assets on PancakeSwap, which was then used by PancakeBunny to incorrectly value the assets in its vaults, leading to an exploit where the attacker was able to drain funds.\n\n5. The root cause of the vulnerability was the reliance on a manipulable price oracle (using PancakeSwap's liquidity pools as a price reference) that could be influenced by flash loans, allowing an attacker to temporarily and significantly alter the perceived value of certain assets held in PancakeBunny's vaults.",
