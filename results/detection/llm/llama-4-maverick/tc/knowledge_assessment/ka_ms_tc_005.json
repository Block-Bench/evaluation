  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Poly Network\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "I am familiar with the Poly Network security incident.\n\n1. The incident occurred in 2021, specifically on August 10.\n2. The approximate financial impact was around $610 million USD.\n3. The type of vulnerability exploited was related to access control, specifically a flaw in the verification process for cross-chain transactions.\n4. The attack worked by manipulating the verification process to allow the attacker to drain funds from the Poly Network's Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Polygon contracts. The attacker was able to generate fake transactions that were accepted as legitimate due to the vulnerability.\n5. The root cause of the vulnerability was a flaw in the implementation of the cross-chain bridge's verification mechanism, which allowed the attacker to bypass security checks and gain unauthorized access to the funds. \n\nI can provide more general information or context if needed, but these answers are based on my understanding of the incident.",
