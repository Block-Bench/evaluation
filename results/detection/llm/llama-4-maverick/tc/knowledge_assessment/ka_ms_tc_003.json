  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Parity Wallet\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "I am familiar with the Parity Wallet security incident on Ethereum.\n\nHere are the details:\n\n1. The incident occurred in 2017, specifically on July 19th, and again on November 6th (there were two separate incidents).\n2. The first incident resulted in the loss of approximately 150,000 Ether, worth around $30 million USD at the time. The second incident resulted in the loss of over 490,000 Ether, worth around $150 million USD at the time.\n3. The vulnerability exploited was related to access control, specifically a multi-signature wallet vulnerability.\n4. The attack worked by exploiting a vulnerability in the Parity Wallet contract's code, which allowed an attacker to gain control over the wallet and drain its funds. In the first incident, the attacker exploited a vulnerability in the wallet's code that allowed them to become the owner of the wallet. In the second incident, a vulnerability in the library contract used by Parity Wallet was exploited, which ultimately led to the loss of funds.\n5. The root cause of the vulnerability was a flaw in the design and implementation of the Parity Wallet contract, specifically related to the use of a library contract that contained a vulnerability. In the second incident, the root cause was related to a vulnerability in the library contract that was used by multiple Parity Wallet contracts, which was accidentally triggered by a user, effectively freezing the funds, but a subsequent analysis revealed that an attacker could potentially exploit it.\n\nI have provided information that I am confident about, based on my knowledge of the incident.",
