  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Sonne Finance\" on optimism?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "I am familiar with the security incident involving \"Sonne Finance\" on Optimism.\n\nHere are the details:\n\n1. The incident occurred in May 2024 (approximate month is known as May 15, 2024, to be more precise, but the exact date is not verified by me, however it is around that time).\n2. The approximate financial impact was around $20 million USD.\n3. The type of vulnerability exploited was related to a donation attack or a price oracle manipulation, more specifically related to a lack of proper handling of donation or price manipulation through a read-only reentrancy or similar mechanism, but the exact categorization might be more nuanced.\n4. The attack worked by manipulating the price oracle of a specific asset on Sonne Finance, which is a lending protocol. The attacker was able to artificially inflate the price of an asset, then borrow other assets against the inflated collateral, effectively draining the protocol.\n5. The root cause of the vulnerability was related to the improper handling or lack of protection against price oracle manipulation. Sonne Finance was using a price oracle that could be manipulated under certain conditions, allowing the attacker to execute the attack.\n\nPlease verify these details as my knowledge might not be up-to-date or entirely accurate.",
