(e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "I am familiar with the \"Qubit Bridge Zero Address Bypass\" incident.\n\nHere are the answers to your questions:\n\n1. The incident occurred in January 2022.\n2. The approximate financial impact was around $80 million USD.\n3. The type of vulnerability exploited was related to access control, specifically a zero-address check bypass.\n4. The attack worked by exploiting a vulnerability in the Qubit Finance bridge contract on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), which allowed the attacker to mint an unlimited amount of xETH (a token representing Ethereum on BSC) by providing a zero address as the target. This was possible because the contract did not properly check for a zero address.\n5. The root cause of the vulnerability was the lack of a proper check for a zero address in the contract's logic, allowing the attacker to bypass the intended access controls.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points.",
