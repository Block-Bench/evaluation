When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "I am familiar with the security incident involving Exactly Protocol on Ethereum.\n\nHere are the details:\n\n1. The incident occurred in August 2023.\n2. The approximate financial impact was around $7.2 million USD.\n3. The type of vulnerability exploited was a flash loan attack, but more specifically, it involved a price oracle manipulation.\n4. The attack worked by manipulating the price oracle used by the Exactly Protocol, allowing the attacker to borrow assets at a manipulated price, and then repaying the loan at the normal price, thus profiting from the difference.\n5. The root cause of the vulnerability was related to the protocol's dependency on a price oracle that could be manipulated through a flash loan, highlighting the importance of robust oracle designs and adequate security measures to prevent such manipulations.\n\nI have provided the information based on my knowledge up to the cutoff date. If there are any updates or more details, I might not be aware of them.",
