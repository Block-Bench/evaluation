  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Cream Finance\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "I am familiar with the security incident involving Cream Finance on Ethereum.\n\nHere are the details:\n\n1. The incident occurred in 2021, specifically on August 27 (and again on October 27).\n2. The approximate financial impact was around $18.8 million (for the August incident) and $130 million (for the October incident).\n3. The type of vulnerability exploited was related to flash loan attacks, specifically using a price oracle manipulation.\n4. The attack worked by manipulating the price oracle of a specific token (YFI or other illiquid tokens), allowing the attacker to borrow a large amount of funds using a flash loan, and then using the manipulated price to drain the Cream Finance lending pool.\n5. The root cause of the vulnerability was related to the use of a centralized and manipulable price oracle (specifically, CoinMarketCap), which allowed the attacker to manipulate the price of the token used as collateral.\n\nPlease let me know if you need more information or if I'm correct.",
