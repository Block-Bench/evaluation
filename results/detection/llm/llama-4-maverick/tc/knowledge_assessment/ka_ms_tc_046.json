  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Munchables\" on blast?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "I am familiar with the Munchables security incident.\n\n1. The incident occurred in 2024, specifically on March 26.\n2. The approximate financial impact was around $62.5 million USD, as it involved the theft of approximately 17,413 ETH.\n3. The type of vulnerability exploited was related to access control, specifically an issue related to ownership or control over the contract.\n4. The attack worked by exploiting a vulnerability that allowed the attacker to gain control over a contract that they shouldn't have had control over, enabling them to drain the funds.\n5. The root cause of the vulnerability was related to a compromised private key or an issue with the ownership management of the contract, but the exact details are that the attacker was able to manipulate their own ownership or executor status on the contract due to a lack of proper access controls or due to a compromised developer or insider involvement, as later reports suggested the attacker was a rogue developer who manipulated their own access.",
