(e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "I am familiar with the Alpha Homora Credit Account Manipulation incident on Ethereum.\n\nHere are the details:\n\n1. The incident occurred in 2021, specifically on February 13.\n2. The approximate financial impact was around $37.5 million USD.\n3. The type of vulnerability exploited was related to a credit account manipulation, which can be classified under a broader category of \"oracle manipulation\" or more specifically, a \"price oracle manipulation\" was not directly the issue, but rather a manipulation of the credit accounting system.\n4. The attack worked by manipulating the credit accounting system of Alpha Homora, specifically targeting the ibETH vaults. The attacker was able to withdraw more funds than they were entitled to, by manipulating the accounting of their credit.\n5. The root cause of the vulnerability was related to the way Alpha Homora's credit accounting system was implemented, which allowed an attacker to manipulate their credit balance.\n\nPlease let me know if you need more information or if there's anything else I can help with.",
