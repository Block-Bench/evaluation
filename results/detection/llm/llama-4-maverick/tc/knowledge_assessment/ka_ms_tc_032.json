When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "I am familiar with the \"Wise Lending Rounding Error\" incident on Ethereum.\n\nHere are the details:\n\n1. The incident occurred in 2022, specifically on November 4-5 (over a couple of days, but the main incident was on November 4).\n2. The approximate financial impact was around $1.1 million USD.\n3. The type of vulnerability exploited was a rounding error, which is related to an arithmetic precision issue.\n4. The attack worked by exploiting a rounding error in the Wise Lending protocol's calculation of user balances, allowing the attacker to drain the protocol's liquidity pools.\n5. The root cause of the vulnerability was a rounding error in the protocol's code, which led to an incorrect calculation of user balances, enabling the attacker to manipulate the system and withdraw more funds than they were entitled to.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to clarify any of these points.",
