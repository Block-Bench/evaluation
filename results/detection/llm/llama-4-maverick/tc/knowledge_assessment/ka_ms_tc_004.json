  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Curve Finance (Vyper Reentrancy)\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "I am familiar with the Curve Finance (Vyper Reentrancy) incident.\n\n1. The incident occurred in 2023, specifically on July 30-31 (approximately).\n2. The approximate financial impact was around $70 million USD.\n3. The type of vulnerability exploited was a reentrancy vulnerability.\n4. The attack worked by exploiting a reentrancy vulnerability in certain Vyper contracts used by Curve Finance, allowing the attacker to drain funds from the pools.\n5. The root cause of the vulnerability was a flaw in the Vyper compiler (specifically, in versions 0.2.15, 0.2.16, and 0.3.0) that led to incorrect handling of reentrancy locks in certain contracts, making them vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. \n\nI have provided the information based on my knowledge.",
