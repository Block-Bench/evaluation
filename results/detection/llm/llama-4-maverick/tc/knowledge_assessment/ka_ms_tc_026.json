The approximate financial impact was around $6.2 million USD.\n3. The type of vulnerability exploited was related to a flash loan attack.\n4. The attack worked by exploiting a vulnerability in the Belt Finance's strategy contract, which allowed the attacker to manipulate the price of the assets and drain the funds using a flash loan.\n5. The root cause of the vulnerability was related to the improper handling of flash loans and the lack of proper validation of the input parameters in the strategy contract.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points.",
