  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Inverse Finance Oracle Manipulation\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "I am familiar with the Inverse Finance Oracle Manipulation incident on Ethereum.\n\nHere are the answers to your questions:\n\n1. The incident occurred in 2022, specifically on April 2, 2022.\n2. The approximate financial impact was around $15.6 million USD.\n3. The type of vulnerability exploited was oracle manipulation.\n4. The attack worked by manipulating the oracle price of a specific token, which was used to collateralize a loan. The attacker was able to artificially inflate the price, allowing them to borrow more funds than they should have been able to, resulting in a significant loss for Inverse Finance.\n5. The root cause of the vulnerability was the reliance on a manipulable oracle price, which was not sufficiently decentralized or robust, allowing the attacker to influence the price feed.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these points.",
