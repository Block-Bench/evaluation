  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Beanstalk\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "I am familiar with the Beanstalk security incident.\n\n1. The incident occurred in 2022, specifically on April 17 (approximately April).\n2. The approximate financial impact was around $182 million USD.\n3. The type of vulnerability exploited was related to a governance attack, specifically taking advantage of a lack of proper access control or sybil resistance in Beanstalk's governance mechanism, which allowed an attacker to manipulate the voting process.\n4. The attack worked by the attacker taking a large flash loan to acquire a majority of the governance tokens (Beanstalk governance tokens are used for voting on proposals), which they then used to pass a malicious proposal that drained the protocol's funds.\n5. The root cause of the vulnerability was the lack of adequate sybil resistance and improper access controls in the governance process, allowing an attacker to accumulate voting power through a flash loan and execute a malicious proposal.",
