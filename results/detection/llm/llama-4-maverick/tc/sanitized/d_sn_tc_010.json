In `borrow()`, the external call to `msg.sender` via `.call{value: amount}(\"\")` on line 68 can be manipulated by an attacker to reenter the contract. Similarly, in `withdraw()`, the use of `.transfer(amount)` on line 89 can also be exploited if the recipient is a contract. Although `.transfer()` has a limited gas stipend which somewhat mitigates reentrancy risk, it's still considered less secure than using a reentrancy guard or the checks-effects-interactions pattern.",
        "attack_scenario": "1. An attacker deposits collateral and borrows funds using `borrow()`. 2. The attacker creates a malicious contract that reenters `borrow()` when it receives ETH. 3. The reentrancy allows the attacker to drain the contract's funds by repeatedly borrowing without sufficient collateral checks after the first call. A similar attack can be performed using `withdraw()` if the attacker can manipulate the `inMarket` status.",

Update state (borrowed amounts). 3. Make external call last. For `withdraw()`: Ensure user has exited the market before withdrawing, and use a reentrancy guard."
