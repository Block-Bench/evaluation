Although the `initializer` modifier checks if the contract is already initialized, the lack of a direct check for `initializing` being true when calling `initialize` externally could potentially lead to issues if the contract is used in a different context. However, in this specific implementation, the `initializer` modifier effectively prevents re-initialization.",
        "attack_scenario": "An attacker attempts to call `initialize` on the `Logic` contract implementation directly (not through the proxy), potentially trying to change the `guardianAddress`. However, since `Logic` is meant to be used behind a proxy, and the proxy will call `initialize` on the implementation contract when it's first deployed, the `initializer` modifier will prevent subsequent initializations. The actual vulnerability here is more about the potential misuse or misunderstanding of how the `initializer` works rather than a straightforward attack vector.",
        "suggested_fix": "Ensure that the `Logic` contract is always used behind a proxy that correctly delegates calls to it, and that the `initialize` function is called appropriately during the deployment process.

The confidence level is set to 0.9 because while the contracts are secure under normal usage, there's a potential for misuse or issues if not used correctly with a proxy."
