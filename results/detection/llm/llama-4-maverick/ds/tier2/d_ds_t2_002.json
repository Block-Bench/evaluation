StakingRewards allows the owner to recover ERC20 tokens, and RewardToken is a basic ERC20 token with minting functionality at deployment. The contracts are generally secure, with proper use of SafeERC20 for token transfers and Ownable for access control. However, it's worth noting that the owner has significant control, including recovering tokens and owning the RewardToken. The key functions are restricted to the owner, and there are no obvious reentrancy or unchecked external call vulnerabilities. The RewardToken contract mints a fixed amount to the owner upon deployment, which is a design choice rather than a vulnerability."
