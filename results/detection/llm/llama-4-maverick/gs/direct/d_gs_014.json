But in _withdrawActiveVotingPower() at line 225, it was being used as an 'isProposalStillOpen()' function, forgetting that it will also be false when the proposal hasn't started yet. This means proposals with future start dates get incorrectly removed from knownProposalIds tracking.",

Line 226: knownProposalIds.remove(_proposalId) - proposal removed from tracking.\n6. Proposal starts a week later, user votes.\n7.
