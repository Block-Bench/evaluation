    "description": "The MinVotingPowerCondition contract allows any users who hold at least plugin.minProposerVotingPower() amount of tokens (locked in the LockManager or in their token balance) to create a proposal and execute LockToVote.createProposal. This logic can be easily bypassed if the token allows flashloan or flashmint. Given that isGranted checks the user's token balance (line 45: token.balanceOf(_who) + lockManager.getLockedBalance(_who)), the user does not even need to lock the flashloaned amount into the LockManager to be able to create and spam proposals.",

    "fix_description": "Avoid using the token's balance and require the user to only use the locked amount. Change line 45 from 'token.balanceOf(_who) + lockManager.getLockedBalance(_who)' to just 'lockManager.getLockedBalance(_who)'. Store the proposal's creator in the proposal struct and require that the locked amount required to create the proposal won't be unlockable until the proposal ends.",

The contract is well-structured and follows best practices. The main functionality is implemented in the isGranted function, which correctly checks the balance and locked balance of the user against the minimum proposer voting power defined by the plugin. The contract does not contain any obvious security vulnerabilities, and the use of immutable variables for plugin, lockManager, and token ensures that these critical addresses cannot be changed after deployment."
