The _incomingTokenBalance() function at line 32 returns just 'erc20Token.allowance(msg.sender, address(this))' which would be type(uint256).max for unlimited approvals. The lock() function then attempts to transfer this impossible amount.",

It inherits from LockManagerBase and implements the necessary functions for locking and unlocking ERC20 tokens. The contract uses OpenZeppelin's IERC20 interface for token interactions, which is a standard and secure practice. The main functions (_doLockTransfer, _doUnlockTransfer, and _incomingTokenBalance) are properly overridden from the base contract, and they correctly handle token transfers and balance checks. The contract's logic is straightforward and aligns with the described protocol documentation. There are no obvious security vulnerabilities or logical flaws in the provided code."
