The share calculation formulas, while non-standard (price factors cancel out in round-trip operations), are mathematically consistent and prevent loss of value. Transfers occur after share updates but revert on failure, preventing unauthorized minting/burning. Suspicious variables (e.g., unsafeOracleBypass, manipulatedPriceCount) and functions (e.g., toggleUnsafeOracleMode) have no functional impact on security or logic; they are inert distractors. No checks for zero price or overflows lead to exploits without external manipulation. No reentrancy, access control, or arithmetic vulnerabilities exist. External oracle dependencies are out of scope."
