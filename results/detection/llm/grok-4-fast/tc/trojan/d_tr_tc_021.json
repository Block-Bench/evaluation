The toggleUnsafePriceMode (lines 110-112) attempts to call a non-existent function on the oracle, causing it to revert harmlessly. No state manipulation, reentrancy, or oracle exploits are possible. Price fetching is view-only and relies on an external stable pool, assumed secure. Deposit and borrow logic correctly handles transfers and checks. Analytics functions are benign.
