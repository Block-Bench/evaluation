It properly updates internal accounting after transfers and includes checks for user balances. No reentrancy risks due to lack of hooks in the pool contract. Public configuration functions exist but do not affect funds or access. Assumes standard ERC777 behavior; minor issues like missing require on withdraw transfer are not exploitable with concrete attacks on standard tokens. No loss of funds, unauthorized access, or state manipulation vulnerabilities found."
