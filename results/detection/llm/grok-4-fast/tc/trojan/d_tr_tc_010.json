Core functions (deposit, borrow, withdraw, exit) update state before ETH transfers, preventing reentrancy. Borrowing is limited by individual health ratios (1.5x collateral) and aggregate liquidity (contract balance). No repay function exists, leading to permanent collateral locks for borrowers and potential illiquidity for depositors, but this is a design limitation, not an exploitable vulnerability. No unauthorized access, fund drainage, or state manipulation paths exist without user intent (e.g., borrowing). Unused Comptroller and public config setters have no security impact. Extra ETH via receive() increases liquidity but cannot be claimed or abused profitably."
