Internal mappings track 'deposits' and 'borrows' without validation or real asset movement, rendering it non-functional. Calculations use a hardcoded empty markets array, always yielding zero borrow power. No funds are held or transferable, preventing loss of funds or unauthorized access. State manipulation (arbitrary mapping updates) has no impactful consequences like drainage or liquidation. Public functions like addMarket lack access control but affect only inert risk scores. No exploitable vulnerabilities exist."
