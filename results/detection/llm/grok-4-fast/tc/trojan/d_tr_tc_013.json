Suspicious elements like public callback bypass, unused counters, and price caching appear as distractors but do not introduce exploitable issues. State updates precede external calls, preventing reentrancy exploits. Direct ETH sends via receive() donate to the contract without inflating user shares, leaving excess as protocol residue without user loss. Price calculations use integer arithmetic with expected flooring, but no unauthorized fund drainage, manipulation, or access paths exist. The contract is secure against untrusted actors."
