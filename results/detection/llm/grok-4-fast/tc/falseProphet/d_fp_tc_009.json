It works correctly for ERC-20 tokens, with supply checking transfer success and withdraw using internal checks. The ERC-777 interface mismatch prevents actual ERC-777 usage (calls revert due to ABI differences), but this is a functional bug, not an exploitable security issue. No reentrancy is possible with standard ERC-20 tokens, as transfers lack hooks. No access control, overflow, or desynchronization vulnerabilities exist with concrete exploits. Assumes standard token behavior; malicious tokens do not lead to protocol fund loss."
