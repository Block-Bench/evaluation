Calculations use empty placeholder arrays, rendering borrow checks always fail for non-zero amounts, blocking unauthorized borrows. Mint allows state inflation without assets, but has no impact as deposits are unused in checks and no redemptions occur. No access control on addMarket exists, but added markets are ignored due to empty iteration. No concrete exploits for fund loss, unauthorized access, or manipulation with security impact. Oracle is trusted and not manipulable externally. Overall, no real vulnerabilities."
