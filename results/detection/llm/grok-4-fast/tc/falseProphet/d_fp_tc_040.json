However, it holds no meaningful state or funds, and external calls provide no special privileges. No exploitable vulnerabilities exist: arbitrary calls do not enable unauthorized access, fund loss, or state manipulation, as operations mirror direct calls. Potential ETH locking from mismatched msg.value occurs only on user error, not malicious exploit. Silent skips for non-CALL actions are functional bugs, not security issues."
