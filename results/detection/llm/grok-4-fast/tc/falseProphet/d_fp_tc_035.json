No funds can enter or exit the contract, preventing any loss of funds or unauthorized access.

Incomplete code (e.g., missing collateral summation) renders borrowing impossible, but this is a functionality issue, not an exploitable security vulnerability. No concrete attack scenarios exist for loss of funds or state manipulation by untrusted parties."
