While there are implementation gaps (e.g., borrow calls fail without prior supply, no interest accrual in accounting, liquidation sets position to zero without updating global totals or repaying debt), these do not enable concrete exploits by untrusted users. No unauthorized fund loss, state manipulation for profit, or access control bypass exists. Borrows revert due to insufficient collateral in cToken. Liquidation alters position state but leaves funds/debt unchanged and unextractable, with no withdrawal functions. Accounting inconsistencies may lead to insolvency over time but require user participation without attacker gain."
