These calls fail unless ownership is explicitly transferred to CrossChainManager, which requires trusted owner action. No unauthorized state manipulation, fund loss, or access is possible without compromising the owner. Hardcoded decoding limits to a specific non-exploitable call. No real vulnerabilities present."
