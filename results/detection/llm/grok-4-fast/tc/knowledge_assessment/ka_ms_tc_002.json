  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Beanstalk\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "1. The incident occurred in April 2022 (specifically on April 17).\n\n2. The approximate financial impact was $182 million USD in stolen funds.\n\n3. The vulnerability exploited was a flash loan attack combined with a governance manipulation.\n\n4. The attacker obtained a flash loan of approximately 6.2 million BEAN tokens from a liquidity pool. They then used these tokens to gain temporary voting power in Beanstalk's governance system by staking them. With this voting power, they submitted and passed a malicious governance proposal that directed the protocol's emergency reserves (in various stablecoins and other assets) to be transferred to an attacker-controlled address. The proposal was executed immediately, allowing the attacker to drain the funds before repaying the flash loan.\n\n5. The root cause was a flaw in the governance mechanism, which allowed staked tokens (including those acquired via flash loans) to be used for voting without sufficient safeguards against economic attacks. There was no delay or multi-step verification process to prevent the immediate execution of proposals by temporarily dominant voters.",
