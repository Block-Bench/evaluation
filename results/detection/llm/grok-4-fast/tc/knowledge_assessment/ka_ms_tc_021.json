  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Inverse Finance Oracle Manipulation\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "1. April 2021.\n\n2. Approximately $1.26 million USD.\n\n3. Oracle manipulation.\n\n4. The attacker used flash loans to manipulate the Uniswap TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) oracle for DAI, temporarily driving down its reported price. This allowed the attacker to borrow a large amount of DAI from Inverse Finance's lending pool at the artificially low collateral value, then repay the flash loans and exit with profits after the oracle price reverted.\n\n5. The protocol relied on a Uniswap-based TWAP oracle that was vulnerable to short-term price manipulation via flash loans, without adequate circuit breakers or manipulation-resistant mechanisms in place.",
