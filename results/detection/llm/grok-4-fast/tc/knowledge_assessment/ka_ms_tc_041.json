  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"DeltaPrime\" on arbitrum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "1. March 2023 (specifically around March 17).\n\n2. Approximately $7 million USD.\n\n3. Flash loan attack exploiting a logic flaw in the liquidation and borrowing mechanism.\n\n4. The attacker used flash loans to borrow large amounts of assets from other protocols, then interacted with DeltaPrime's contracts to open leveraged positions without sufficient collateral checks. By manipulating the sequence of transactions, the attacker drained liquidity from the protocol's pools before the positions could be properly liquidated.\n\n5. The root cause was a smart contract logic error in the margin trading and liquidation functions, which failed to properly validate collateral requirements during rapid, multi-step transactions enabled by flash loans. This allowed temporary balance inflation to bypass safeguards.",
