  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Radiant Capital Rounding Exploit\" on arbitrum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "1. October 2023 (specifically around October 6).\n\n2. Approximately $50 million USD.\n\n3. Rounding vulnerability (in interest rate calculations).\n\n4. The attacker exploited a rounding error in the protocol's borrow interest accrual mechanism on the USDC market. By repeatedly borrowing and repaying small amounts, the attacker could manipulate the rounding in the contract's math to accrue negative interest or create discrepancies in balances, allowing them to drain liquidity from the lending pool without proper collateral checks.\n\n5. The root cause was imprecise integer arithmetic in the smart contract's interest calculation function, where rounding down in certain scenarios led to under-accrued interest for lenders and enabled the attacker to exploit the imbalance for unauthorized withdrawals.",
