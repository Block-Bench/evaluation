When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "1. September 2022.\n\n2. Approximately $19 million USD.\n\n3. Oracle manipulation.\n\n4. The attacker exploited a manipulable oracle price feed (based on Uniswap TWAP for the UwU token) by using flash loans to perform large swaps on Uniswap, artificially depressing the token's price. This allowed the attacker to borrow significant amounts of other assets (like ETH and USDC) at the undervalued collateral rate, repay the flash loans, and extract the borrowed funds before the price corrected.\n\n5. The root cause was the protocol's reliance on a TWAP oracle from Uniswap that could be manipulated through large, temporary trades (via flash loans), without sufficient safeguards like longer TWAP windows or manipulation-resistant mechanisms.",
