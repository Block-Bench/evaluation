  "response": "1. May 2023 (specifically around May 31).\n2. Approximately $21 million USD.\n3. Flash loan attack exploiting a liquidation incentive miscalculation (economic vulnerability in the liquidation mechanism).\n4. The attacker used flash loans to borrow large amounts of assets, manipulated the protocol's liquidation process by creating undercollateralized positions, and exploited a flaw in how liquidation incentives were calculated. This allowed the attacker to repeatedly liquidate positions and siphon off rewards/incentives far exceeding the actual value, draining liquidity pools before repaying the flash loans.\n5. The root cause was a bug in the smart contract's liquidation incentive formula, which did not properly account for or cap the incentives during rapid, automated liquidations, enabling the attacker to extract excessive rewards from the protocol's reserves.",
