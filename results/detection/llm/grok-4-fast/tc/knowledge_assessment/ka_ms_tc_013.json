  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"bZx Protocol\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "1. February 2020 (specifically around February 15).\n\n2. Approximately $350,000 USD.\n\n3. Flash loan attack combined with oracle manipulation.\n\n4. The attacker used a flash loan from dYdX to borrow a large amount of ETH, then manipulated the Kyber Network oracle price feed by executing wash trades on Uniswap's low-liquidity pools. This artificially depressed the ETH price, allowing the attacker to borrow excessive funds against collateral (like WBTC) at the manipulated low price via bZx's lending protocol. The attacker then repaid the flash loan and pocketed the excess borrowed funds before the oracle price corrected.\n\n5. The root cause was over-reliance on a manipulable oracle (Kyber) for price feeds, without sufficient safeguards against flash loan-induced price manipulation in low-liquidity DEX pools. The protocol did not implement multi-oracle aggregation or time-weighted average pricing to prevent such attacks.",
