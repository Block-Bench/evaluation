  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Lendf.Me\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "1. April 2020 (specifically around April 19).\n\n2. Approximately $25 million USD.\n\n3. Flash loan attack combined with oracle manipulation.\n\n4. The attacker initiated a flash loan from dYdX to borrow a large amount of ETH, which was then swapped on Uniswap to manipulate the price of Aave's aTokens (interest-bearing tokens used as collateral in Lendf.Me). This artificially inflated the perceived value of the attacker's collateral in Lendf.Me, allowing them to borrow significantly more assets (like USDC and DAI) than they should have. The attacker then repaid the flash loan and extracted the excess borrowed funds, draining liquidity from the protocol.\n\n5. The root cause was the protocol's reliance on manipulable on-chain price oracles (Uniswap prices) for collateral valuation without sufficient safeguards against flash loan-induced price swings, leading to inaccurate asset pricing during the attack.",
