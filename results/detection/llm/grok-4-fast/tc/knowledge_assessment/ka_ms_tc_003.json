  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Parity Wallet\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "1. July 2017 (specifically around July 19-20).\n\n2. Approximately $30 million USD (based on 150,000 ETH stolen at the time's exchange rate).\n\n3. Access control vulnerability.\n\n4. The Parity multi-signature wallet contract had a flaw where the `initWallet` function, intended only for the wallet's creator to call during initialization, was declared as public. An attacker exploited this by calling `initWallet` on uninitialized wallet contracts, thereby becoming the sole owner. They then used owner privileges to transfer out the ETH held in those wallets.\n\n5. The root cause was improper access control in the smart contract code: the `initWallet` function lacked restrictions (e.g., a modifier to ensure it could only be called by the deployer), allowing any external account to invoke it and hijack ownership of deployed but uninitialized contracts.",
