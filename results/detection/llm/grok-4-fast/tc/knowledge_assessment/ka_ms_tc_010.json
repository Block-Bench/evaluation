  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Rari Capital Fuse\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "1. April 2021\n2. Approximately $11 million USD\n3. Access control vulnerability\n4. The attacker used flash loans to interact with the Fuse lending pools, exploiting a flaw that allowed unauthorized calls to internal functions responsible for updating pool states (such as total borrows and assets). This enabled the attacker to borrow funds without sufficient collateral or proper accounting, draining liquidity from multiple pools (primarily USDC and DAI pools).\n5. The root cause was inadequate access controls in the smart contracts of the Fuse lending protocol, where certain state-updating functions (like those handling interest accrual and borrow tracking) could be invoked by arbitrary users without authorization checks, leading to manipulable pool balances.",
