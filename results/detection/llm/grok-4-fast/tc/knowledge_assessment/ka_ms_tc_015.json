  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Indexed Finance Pool Manipulation\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "1. December 2021 (specifically around December 23).\n\n2. Approximately $16 million USD.\n\n3. Flash loan attack combined with pool manipulation.\n\n4. The attacker used flash loans to temporarily inflate the ETH balance in the mETH index pool (a synthetic ETH pool). This manipulation distorted the pool's net asset value (NAV), allowing the attacker to deposit a small amount of collateral and withdraw a disproportionately large amount of assets (like wBTC and other tokens) before the pool rebalanced. The excess assets were then swapped for profit, and the flash loans were repaid.\n\n5. The root cause was a design flaw in the pool's deposit and withdrawal logic, which did not adequately verify or protect against rapid balance manipulations that could skew the NAV calculation during atomic transactions.",
