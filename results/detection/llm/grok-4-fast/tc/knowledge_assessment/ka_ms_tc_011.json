  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"PancakeHunny (PancakeBunny)\" on bsc?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "1. The incident occurred in May 2021 (specifically on May 19).\n\n2. The approximate financial impact was around $45 million USD, primarily in drained liquidity from the platform's pools (though the total value of manipulated tokens was reported higher, the realized loss was in this range).\n\n3. Flash loan attack combined with price manipulation.\n\n4. The attacker borrowed a large amount of funds via a flash loan (from platforms like Venus Protocol), used it to buy up BUNNY tokens on PancakeSwap, artificially inflating the token's price. They then withdrew funds from PancakeBunny's yield farming pools at the inflated rate, receiving a massive amount of BUNNY tokens. Finally, they sold off the tokens, crashing the price and profiting from the arbitrage while draining the pools.\n\n5. The root cause was the platform's reliance on a manipulable automated market maker (AMM) price oracle (PancakeSwap) without sufficient safeguards against flash loan-induced price swings, allowing attackers to temporarily distort token prices and exploit the yield optimization mechanism.",
