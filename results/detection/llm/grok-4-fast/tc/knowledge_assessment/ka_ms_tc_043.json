  "response": "1. August 2021  \n2. Approximately $1.5 million USD  \n3. Access control vulnerability  \n4. Attackers exploited a flaw in the PlayDapp staking smart contract on Ethereum, which allowed unauthorized users to call a minting function and generate new PLA tokens without proper validation or restrictions. They minted around 1.7 million tokens and then sold them on the open market.  \n5. The root cause was inadequate access controls in the smart contract code, specifically failing to restrict sensitive functions like token minting to only authorized addresses or roles.",
