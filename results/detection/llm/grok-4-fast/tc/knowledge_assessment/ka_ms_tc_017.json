  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Warp Finance LP Token Price Manipulation\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "1. November 2020 (specifically around November 17).\n\n2. Approximately $7.5 million USD.\n\n3. Flash loan attack combined with price manipulation (oracle manipulation via liquidity pool pricing).\n\n4. The attacker used a flash loan to borrow a large amount of WBTC from dYdX, then swapped it on Uniswap to artificially inflate the price of the Warp LP token (representing a position in Yearn's yCRV vault). This manipulated the perceived value in Warp's redemption mechanism, allowing the attacker to deposit a small amount of the LP token and redeem a much larger value of underlying assets (like yCRV and CRV) from the Warp pool before repaying the flash loan and profiting from the drained funds.\n\n5. The root cause was the protocol's reliance on real-time Uniswap prices for LP tokens without using time-weighted average prices (TWAP) or slippage protections, making it vulnerable to flash loan-induced price manipulation in the oracle mechanism.",
