When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "1. October 2021 (specifically around October 27).\n\n2. Approximately $150 million USD.\n\n3. Flash loan attack exploiting a smart contract logic vulnerability (related to improper validation in borrow and supply functions).\n\n4. The attacker used flash loans from another protocol (like Aave) to borrow large amounts of assets, then interacted with Cream Finance's Iron Bank lending pools (targeting yUSD and USDC). By repeatedly supplying and borrowing in a manipulated sequence, the attacker inflated their balances and drained liquidity from the pools without sufficient collateral checks, effectively stealing the funds before repaying the flash loans.\n\n5. The root cause was a flaw in the Iron Bank smart contract's borrow and supply logic, which lacked proper slippage protection and balance validations, allowing the attacker to manipulate exchange rates and extract value beyond intended limits.",
