  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Belt Finance Strategy Exploit\" on binance_smart_chain?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "1. May 2021 (specifically around May 28).\n\n2. Approximately $1.01 million USD.\n\n3. Access control vulnerability.\n\n4. The attacker exploited a flaw in Belt Finance's strategy contracts on BSC, where certain functions (like harvesting rewards) lacked proper permission checks. This allowed the attacker to unauthorizedly call these functions on affected vaults, minting excessive shares or draining underlying assets without legitimate deposits.\n\n5. The root cause was insufficient access control modifiers on sensitive functions within the strategy implementation, enabling unauthorized interactions with the vault contracts.",
