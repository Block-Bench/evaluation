  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Pickle Finance\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "1. October 2021.\n\n2. Approximately $20 million USD.\n\n3. Flash loan attack.\n\n4. The attacker used a flash loan to borrow a large amount of ETH, which was then deposited into a Pickle \"jar\" (a yield farming wrapper). This manipulated the jar's balance calculations during a simulation step, allowing the attacker to withdraw a much larger amount of underlying assets (like yCRV tokens) than they had actually contributed. The borrowed funds were repaid, and the excess assets were stolen.\n\n5. The root cause was a vulnerability in the jar contracts' balance verification logic, where the `simulate` function did not properly account for flash loan manipulations, enabling the attacker to inflate perceived deposits and bypass withdrawal limits.",
