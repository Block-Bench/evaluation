  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"KyberSwap Elastic\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "1. November 2023 (specifically on or around November 22).\n\n2. Approximately $48 million USD.\n\n3. Manipulation of the dynamic fee mechanism (exploiting a flaw in fee tier selection, combined with flash loans).\n\n4. The attacker used flash loans to manipulate the virtual reserves of affected KyberSwap Elastic liquidity pools on Ethereum. This manipulation tricked the contract's fee tier selection logic into applying a lower fee rate than intended. As a result, the attacker could perform swaps at artificially favorable rates, repeatedly draining liquidity from the pools across multiple chains (primarily Ethereum) before the flash loans were repaid.\n\n5. The root cause was a bug in the KyberSwap Elastic v2 smart contract's implementation of dynamic fees, where the fee tier was incorrectly determined based on manipulable virtual reserve values rather than more robust on-chain state checks, allowing external manipulation.",
