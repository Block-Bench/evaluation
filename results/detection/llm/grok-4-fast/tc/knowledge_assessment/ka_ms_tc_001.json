  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Nomad Bridge\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "1. The incident occurred in August 2022.\n\n2. The approximate financial impact was $190 million USD.\n\n3. The vulnerability was an access control flaw, specifically improper validation of cross-chain messages.\n\n4. The attack exploited the bridge's reliance on a multi-signature-like system from \"replica\" contracts on connected chains. Attackers identified that the bridge's Ethereum contract did not verify whether incoming messages were legitimately signed by authorized replicas. They copied valid withdrawal messages from other chains (e.g., Moonbeam) and replayed them on Ethereum, tricking the bridge into minting tokens without burning the corresponding assets on the source chain. This allowed rapid drainage of funds across multiple assets.\n\n5. The root cause was a misconfiguration in the message validation logic: the contract checked the message format and signatures but failed to enforce that the messages originated from whitelisted or authorized replica addresses, enabling forgery by any attacker.",
