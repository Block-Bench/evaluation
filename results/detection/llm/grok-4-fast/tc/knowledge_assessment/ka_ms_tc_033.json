  "response": "1. September 2022\n2. Approximately $8.5 million USD\n3. Access control vulnerability in delegate approvals\n4. The attacker exploited the delegate approval mechanism by submitting a transaction that approved a malicious contract as a delegate for user funds. This allowed the malicious contract to execute unauthorized transfers from the protocol's liquidity pools, draining assets like USDC and ETH.\n5. The root cause was insufficient validation in the smart contract's delegate approval function, which did not properly restrict or verify the delegate's permissions, enabling over-approval and unauthorized spending.",
