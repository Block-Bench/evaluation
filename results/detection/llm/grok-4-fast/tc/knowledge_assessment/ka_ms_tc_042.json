  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Penpie\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "1. The incident occurred in 2024, specifically on May 12.\n\n2. The approximate financial impact was $27 million USD.\n\n3. The vulnerability exploited was an arithmetic precision error (related to rounding in share calculations).\n\n4. The attacker called the `mintShares` function on the Penpie contract with a very small amount of ETH (less than 1 wei), which due to a flooring error in the share price calculation, allowed minting a disproportionately large number of shares. These shares were then redeemed for a full ETH deposit, effectively draining funds from the protocol. The attacker repeated this process multiple times.\n\n5. The root cause was improper handling of rounding in the share price formula, where integer division floored the result to zero in edge cases, enabling the over-minting of shares without corresponding value deposited.",
