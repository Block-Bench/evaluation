  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Spartan Protocol Liquidity Miscalculation\" on binance_smart_chain?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "1. May 2021 (specifically around May 2).\n\n2. Approximately $30 million USD.\n\n3. Liquidity miscalculation (a smart contract math/logic error).\n\n4. The attacker exploited a flaw in the Spartan Protocol's liquidity provision mechanism on Binance Smart Chain. By calling the `addLiquidity` function with manipulated parameters (such as zero or negligible amounts for certain tokens), the contract incorrectly calculated the total liquidity in the pool, allowing the attacker to inflate perceived liquidity. This enabled them to perform unauthorized withdrawals or swaps that drained real assets from the pool, effectively stealing funds without providing equivalent value.\n\n5. The root cause was a bug in the smart contract's liquidity calculation logic, specifically in how the contract handled and validated reserve ratios and total liquidity during liquidity addition/removal operations, leading to an underestimation of required collateral and over-allowance of withdrawals.",
