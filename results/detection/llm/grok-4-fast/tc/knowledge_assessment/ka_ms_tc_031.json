  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Gamma Strategies Hypervisor\" on arbitrum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "1. October 2023 (specifically around October 9).\n\n2. Approximately $3.4 million USD.\n\n3. Flash loan attack combined with a logic flaw in liquidity calculations.\n\n4. The attacker used a flash loan to temporarily manipulate the liquidity pool balances on Uniswap V3 (which the Hypervisor interacts with). This allowed them to deposit a minimal amount of tokens while withdrawing a disproportionately large share of the vault's underlying assets (ETH and USDC), effectively draining the vault before the flash loan was repaid.\n\n5. The root cause was a bug in the Hypervisor smart contract's deposit and withdrawal functions, which failed to properly account for rapid changes in pool liquidity and share pricing, enabling the manipulation without sufficient validation.",
