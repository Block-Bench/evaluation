  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Alpha Homora Credit Account Manipulation\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "1. February 2021 (specifically, February 13).\n\n2. Approximately $37 million USD.\n\n3. Flash loan attack exploiting a logic flaw in credit account management (related to improper state validation).\n\n4. The attacker used flash loans to manipulate the state of a borrower's credit account in Alpha Homora V2. By executing a series of transactions within the flash loan callback, they altered the account's position to appear over-collateralized, allowing unauthorized borrowing of assets from liquidity pools (primarily wBTC and ETH pairs on Cream Finance integration). The funds were then swapped and extracted before the flash loan was repaid.\n\n5. The root cause was a smart contract logic vulnerability in the credit account system, where the protocol failed to properly validate or snapshot the account state during reentrant or multi-step transactions, enabling manipulation without sufficient checks on collateral or position integrity.",
