However, no exploitable security vulnerabilities exist: borrowing requires personal collateral, reentrancy is prevented by pre-update checks and liquidity limits, integer division in health checks causes minor undercollateralization for small amounts but no profitable attack, and accidental ETH sends increase pool liquidity without enabling unauthorized withdrawals or drains. The unused Comptroller interface indicates incomplete integration but poses no security risk. Global liquidity is managed via balance checks, and per-user limits prevent over-borrowing."
