The addLiquidity uses an averaging mechanism for minting units, which allows imbalanced additions that alter the reserve ratio, but effective add-remove cycles simulate fair swaps at the current ratio without arbitrage opportunities. Initial additions with zero of one asset are possible but do not enable fund theft; they may lead to division-by-zero reverts in subsequent adds if one reserve is zero, but this only causes a denial-of-service on adding liquidity, not loss of funds or unauthorized access. Removals are proportional and revert on underflow. No reentrancy, access control, or other exploitable issues exist. The contract is secure against concrete attacks."
