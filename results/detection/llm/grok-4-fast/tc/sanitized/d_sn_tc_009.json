This renders supplying unusable, but does not enable exploits like unauthorized fund drainage. Withdraw (lines 53-75) updates state after transfer without checking the bool return, but ERC-777 standard requires reverts on failure, preventing silent failures. No reentrancy risk exists, as hooks either aren't called (via registry) or cause revert if direct. Direct token sends could lock funds (no rescue mechanism), but this requires user error, not an attack. No concrete, exploitable security issues with loss of funds or unauthorized access by untrusted parties."
