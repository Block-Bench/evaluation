It only computes hypothetical output amounts based on fetched reserves from computed pair addresses, which may revert or return incorrect values due to non-existent pairs or flawed formulas, but these are usability issues, not exploitable security vulnerabilities. No concrete attack scenarios exist as the function is effectively read-only and harmless."
