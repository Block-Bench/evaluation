No reentrancy risks, as state changes precede token transfers without callbacks. Calculations use Solidity 0.8 safe math. Access controls are appropriately public for users. Oracle relies on external trusted pool, but no concrete manipulation path exists without loss (virtual price is resistant). Missing features like repayment, withdrawal, and liquidation represent design incompleteness but not exploitable vulnerabilities. No unauthorized access, fund loss via code flaws, or state manipulation possible without external market risks, which are not smart contract bugs."
