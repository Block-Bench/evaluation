No exploitable vulnerabilities found: access controls are enforced, transfers occur after state updates preventing reentrancy, and admin functions (e.g., changing recipients, emergency unlocks) rely on trusted roles, which are not considered vulnerabilities. The unused configStorage and playerBalances mappings are dead code but pose no security risk. Multiple locks overwrite settings without accumulating, potentially stranding funds via user error, but this lacks a malicious exploit path and is a design issue, not a security concern."
