While the integer division allows slightly higher LTV for very small deposits (up to 100% for 1 wei), no concrete exploit exists to drain funds without providing equivalent collateral, as net effect on pool balance is neutral. The unused Comptroller interface is dead code but harmless. Lack of repay function locks collateral after borrowing, but this is a design limitation affecting users' own funds, not an exploitable security issue by untrusted parties. No reentrancy, access control, or unauthorized fund loss vulnerabilities found. Shared liquidity is protected by individual health checks."
