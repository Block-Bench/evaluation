The external call in createLockedCampaign to an arbitrary tokenLocker address carries reentrancy risk, but no state changes occur after the call, and no assets are at stake. No claim or payout logic exists, preventing loss of funds or unauthorized access. Access controls (manager-only cancellation) are properly enforced. No exploitable vulnerabilities found."
