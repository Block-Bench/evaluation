However, these do not constitute exploitable security vulnerabilities. Borrowing requires prior external supply to the cToken from the contract address, which is out of scope and assumes trusted setup. No untrusted party can cause loss of funds, unauthorized access, or state manipulation without contract control. View functions may revert in edge cases (e.g., division by zero post-repay), but this is a DoS on views, not a security issue per criteria. The contract is functionally broken but secure against exploits."
