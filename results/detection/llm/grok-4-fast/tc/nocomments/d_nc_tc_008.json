The withdrawAll function subtracts from balance before sending funds and requires the send to succeed, preventing overdrafts or multiple withdrawals via reentrancy. Reentrancy attempts cause the transaction to revert due to insufficient funds for the inner send, restoring all state without loss. No paths exist for unauthorized fund drainage, state manipulation, or access violations. Minor issues like lack of balance checks are protected by the require and uint underflow reversion. The contract is secure against common vulnerabilities like reentrancy, overflows, or unauthorized access."
