IERC20(NEW_TUSD).transfer(attacker, balance) executes, transferring all tokens to the attacker, resulting in total loss of funds.",

Mint is also broken (uses transfer instead of transferFrom at line 28), preventing deposits and making the contract unusable, but this is a functional bug rather than an exploitable security issue. No other vulnerabilities found; the contract assumes trusted admin but exposes funds to untrusted parties."
