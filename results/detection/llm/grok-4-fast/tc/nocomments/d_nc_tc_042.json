However, no exploitable security vulnerabilities exist: no unauthorized fund loss, state manipulation, or access without trusted roles. Deposits/withdraws only work for ERC20-compliant addresses (trapping tokens unnecessarily but reversibly). Claiming relies on external PendleMarket behavior, which is out-of-scope and non-speculatively safe. No reentrancy, access control, or arithmetic issues. YieldMarketRegister is inert and harmless."
