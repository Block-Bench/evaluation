However, this call reverts due to onlyOwner modifier unless CrossChainManager is explicitly set as owner, which requires trusted owner action. No unauthenticated exploits possible for fund loss, unauthorized access, or state manipulation. The code is incomplete/broken for intended functionality but secure against external attacks."
