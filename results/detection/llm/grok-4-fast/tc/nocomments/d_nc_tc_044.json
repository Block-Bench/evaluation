State updates precede token transfers, preventing reentrancy. Calculations preserve the exchange rate correctly. No access control issues, as the design allows open minting/redeeming. Decimals mismatch is a design choice, not a security flaw. No exploitable vulnerabilities found; the contract handles funds securely without borrowing functionality."
