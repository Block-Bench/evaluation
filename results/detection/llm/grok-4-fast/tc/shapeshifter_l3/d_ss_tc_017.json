State changes precede external transfers, preventing reentrancy. Value calculation sums underlying token amounts, which assumes paired tokens have equivalent unit values (e.g., stables); mismatches could undervalue collateral but do not enable exploits like fund theft or unauthorized actions, as the pair is fixed at deployment. No liquidation exists, risking undercollateralization from reserve changes, but this affects users without allowing external manipulation for profit. No access control issues, overflows handled by Solidity 0.8, and no trusted role dependencies for exploits."
