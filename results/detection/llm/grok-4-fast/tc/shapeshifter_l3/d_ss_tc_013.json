State updates occur safely before external calls, arithmetic is exact with no rounding losses, and the price mechanism maintains parity. The empty call in transfers is non-functional but harmless, causing no reentrancy or fund loss risks. Direct ETH sends via receive() donate to the pool, benefiting holders without enabling exploits.
