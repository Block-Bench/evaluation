The optional low-level call to an arbitrary address for 'createTokenLock' uses caller-provided parameters but sends no value, reverts on failure, and enables no concrete exploitation of this contract (e.g., no reentrancy harm, no unauthorized fund loss or state manipulation beyond intended access). Obfuscation and unused IERC20 are stylistic, not vulnerabilities. No exploitable issues found."
