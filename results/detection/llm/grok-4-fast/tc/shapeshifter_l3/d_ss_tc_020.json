No token transfers occur, so positions only track abstract collateral and debt values without moving assets. External calls are limited to cToken.mint, which fails without pre-sent underlying tokens. No reentrancy, access control bypasses, or arithmetic issues exist due to Solidity 0.8+. Liquidation clears undercollateralized positions (collateral < 1.5 * debt) but performs no asset seizure or transfer, resulting in harmless state changes. No concrete exploits lead to fund loss, unauthorized access, or harmful manipulation, as no funds can be deposited or withdrawn."
