This renders deposits impossible, preventing any funds from entering the contract. Withdrawals thus cannot occur meaningfully. While `dischargeFunds` has a reentrancy pattern (external call before state update), exploitation does not yield extra funds due to the token contract's balance checks during transfers, which prevent over-withdrawal without underflow reverts. No concrete attack leads to loss of funds, unauthorized access, or state manipulation exploitable by untrusted parties. The contract is non-functional but poses no security risks."
