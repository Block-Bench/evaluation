Key functions enforce entry to market, health validation before/after advances, and withdrawal only when not in market and debt-free. No repay function exists, locking users with debt, but this is a design limitation, not an exploitable security issue. Reentrancy is mitigated by immediate balance reduction on transfers and pre/post health checks. Direct ETH sends via receive() increase balance but do not affect individual collateral tracking or enable over-borrowing, as limits are per-user. Syntax errors (e.g., msg.requestor, msg.measurement) prevent compilation but do not introduce security vulnerabilities in intent. Unused Comptroller integration is incomplete but not exploitable. No concrete attack paths for fund loss or unauthorized access by untrusted parties."
