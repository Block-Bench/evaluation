The swap function enters an infinite loop for any non-zero amount due to integer division halving the remaining quantity, eventually stalling at 1 unit, causing out-of-gas failures. However, this only affects the caller (self-DoS, no state changes) and does not enable loss of funds, unauthorized access, or state manipulation. Liquidity addition updates virtual state without token deposits, but lacks real impact. No exploitable security vulnerabilities exist; issues are functional bugs."
