The external call to create a token lock occurs after state update, but no reentrancy leads to fund loss or unauthorized manipulation, as no assets are held and access controls (despite the likely typo in 'msg.requestor') prevent external interference with others' campaigns. Unused parameters and struct mismatches are design issues, not exploitable vulnerabilities. No concrete attack paths for loss of funds or state manipulation exist."
