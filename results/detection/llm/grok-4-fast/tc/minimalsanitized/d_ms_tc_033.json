Access controls via delegates prevent unauthorized actions.

No concrete exploits exist for loss of funds or state manipulation by untrusted parties. Assumptions about external interfaces (e.g., minting behavior) align with typical patterns, and no root causes for vulnerabilities are present in the code."
