Funds are pooled, but borrowing is limited by individual deposits, preventing over-borrowing. The balance check in borrow ensures sufficient liquidity. No repay function exists, locking remaining collateral for borrowers, but this is a usability flaw, not an exploitable vulnerability. Extra ETH via receive() increases balance but cannot be withdrawn or used to exceed collateral limits. No reentrancy, unauthorized access, or fund drainage paths exist. Comptroller integration is unused but does not introduce risks."
