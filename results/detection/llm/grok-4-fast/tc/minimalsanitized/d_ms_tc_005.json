In EthCrossChainManager, verification functions are placeholders that always succeed, but the hardcoded decoding in _decodeTx targets only the owner-restricted putCurEpochConPubKeyBytes on dataContract. Low-level calls fail the onlyOwner check (msg.sender is EthCrossChainManager, not owner), causing reverts on require(success). No funds are handled, and no state changes or unauthorized actions are possible without owner compromise, which is out of scope. No exploitable vulnerabilities exist."
