State updates precede external calls in mint and redeem, preventing reentrancy. Exchange rate calculations are consistent and account for the contract's cash balance. totalBorrows and totalReserves remain at 0 due to absent borrow logic, but this does not introduce vulnerabilities in the provided supply/redeem functionality. Transfers assume standard ERC20 behavior (revert on failure), suitable for WETH. No exploitable issues like unauthorized access, fund loss, or state manipulation exist without trusted role compromise."
