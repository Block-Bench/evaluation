As a result, no real assets can enter or exit the contract; baseAmount and tokenAmount are purely virtual counters. While the liquidity unit calculation uses an average of ratios (potentially allowing imbalanced additions if transfers existed), no concrete fund loss is possible without deposit mechanisms. State changes occur as intended via public functions, with no unauthorized access or exploitable manipulation leading to security impacts. Solidity 0.8 safe math prevents underflows. The contract is incomplete but not vulnerable to exploits."
