However, the contract uses NEW_TUSD for deposits (mint) and withdrawals (redeem), while 'underlying' is incorrectly set to OLD_TUSD. This mismatch enables draining the contract's NEW_TUSD balance, as the require check at line 39 fails to protect the actual underlying asset used in operations.",
        "attack_scenario": "1. A user calls mint(amount), transferring NEW_TUSD to the contract and increasing their accountTokens balance. 2. An attacker calls sweepToken(NEW_TUSD). Since NEW_TUSD != OLD_TUSD (underlying), the require passes. 3. The contract transfers its entire NEW_TUSD balance to the attacker. 4. Original users cannot redeem, as NEW_TUSD is drained, resulting in permanent fund loss.",
        "suggested_fix": "Update the require in sweepToken to check against NEW_TUSD: require(token != NEW_TUSD, 'Cannot sweep underlying token');. Alternatively, set underlying = NEW_TUSD in the constructor (line 25) to match the actual token used. Add access control, e.g., require(msg.sender == admin, 'Only admin'), to restrict sweeping."
      }
    ],
    "overall_explanation": "The contract is a basic token wrapper but has a critical flaw in sweepToken due to a token address mismatch: it protects the wrong underlying (OLD_TUSD) while using NEW_TUSD for all operations. This allows anyone to drain deposited funds. No other exploitable issues found; admin role is unused, and balances are simple counters without further vulnerabilities."
