However, no real exploitable vulnerabilities exist: borrow always reverts due to oracle=0, preventing debt accrual or unauthorized transfers. Deposits and withdraws function correctly for the depositor (or onBehalfOf), with no loss of funds or state manipulation possible without borrow succeeding. These are correctness issues, not security vulnerabilities per criteria."
