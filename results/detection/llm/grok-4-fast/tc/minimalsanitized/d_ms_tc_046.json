While there is a functional bug where multiple successive lock() calls can lead to stuck funds (playerBalances accumulates but unlock transfers only the last lockedAmount and resets balance to 0), this is not exploitable by an untrusted party and results from user misuse rather than an attack vector. Admin functions (e.g., setLockRecipient, emergencyUnlock) enable fund redirection but require admin compromise, which is out of scope. No reentrancy, access control bypass, or arithmetic issues found. Dead code like configStorage exists but poses no security risk. Overall, no untrusted exploits possible."
