Attacker calls deposit(0, 10, attacker), sum deposit=10 (value=10). Pre-transfer check passes (current sum=200 within 5% of lastTotalValue=200). Shares minted = 200 * 10 / 200 = 10. New totals: total0=100, total1=110, value=1110, shares=210. Attacker's 10 shares \u22484.76% worth \u224852.9 (profit 42.9). Repeatable within deviation limit across blocks/transactions until 100-block update.",

Add function to fetch sqrtPriceX96 from pool.slot0(), compute value0 = amount0, value1 = (amount1 * 2**96) / sqrtPriceX96 (adjusted for decimals/ticks). Use value0 + value1 for shares: shares = totalSupply * (value_deposit) / total_value. Update _checkPriceDeviation to use values instead of sums. Implement oracle or TWAP for accuracy."

    "overall_explanation": "The contract is a flawed liquidity vault with incorrect share pricing based on token amount sums, enabling economic attacks via dilution (high confidence). Liquidity management functions are empty, rendering it ineffective as a hypervisor, but this is a design flaw, not exploitable. Price deviation checks on sums are meaningless without pricing oracle, exacerbating unfairness but limiting exploit scale to ~5%. No other exploitable issues like reentrancy or access control found; funds held but not LP'd, exposing to opportunity cost."
