It lacks exploitable vulnerabilities such as reentrancy, unauthorized access, or fund loss, as no funds are handled or moved. Functional issues exist (e.g., incorrect reserve mapping for token order, unused parameters like amountOutMin and deadline, oversimplified AMM formula without fees), but these are not security concerns with concrete exploits. The code is safe from an security auditing perspective."
