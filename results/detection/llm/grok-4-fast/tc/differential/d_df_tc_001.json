The _messageRoot function computes a hash of the input, requiring it to match acceptedRoot, which is preimage-resistant under keccak256. No concrete exploits exist for unauthorized processing, as attackers cannot feasibly find valid preimages without trusted knowledge. The low-level call to bridgeRouter is gated by this check, preventing arbitrary execution. Owner-controlled root updates are by design and not exploitable by untrusted parties. Unused elements like nonces and Pending status are harmless. The lack of actual Merkle proof verification renders the contract non-functional as a bridge but not insecure."
