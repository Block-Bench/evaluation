Virtual reserves and supply inflate the exchange rate but do not lead to fund loss, as users can always redeem an amount equal to their deposited underlying by redeeming an appropriate portion of cTokens, leaving unbacked tokens behind. No reentrancy risks due to checks-effects-interactions pattern. Unit mismatch in minimum liquidity check is a logical error but not exploitable, as initial mint requires sufficient underlying coincidentally matching cToken units at rate 1e18. No unauthorized access, theft, or state manipulation possible without trusted roles (none exist)."
