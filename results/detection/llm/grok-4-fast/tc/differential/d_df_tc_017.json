Assuming the LP token is correctly configured as a stable-stable pair with matching decimals (e.g., USDC-USDT), the valuation via pro-rata reserves is accurate. Functions handle deposits, borrows, repays, and withdrawals with appropriate checks. No reentrancy risks, as state updates precede transfers. Price protection prevents large deviations but may disable borrowing on sustained >10% price moves (design limitation, not exploitable). No unauthorized access, fund loss, or state manipulation by untrusted parties. Misconfiguration of LP token could lead to issues, but this relies on trusted deployment."
