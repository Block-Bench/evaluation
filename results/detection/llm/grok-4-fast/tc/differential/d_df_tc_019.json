Core logic mirrors Uniswap V2 patterns, correctly calculating inputs from balance changes post-output transfer and enforcing the constant product invariant after fees. Direct token transfers without mint do not enable unauthorized extractions, as the k-check prevents k-decreases. Potential uint112 truncation on large balances is theoretically possible but unrealistic (exceeds typical ERC20 supplies) and not exploitable without trusted actions. No reentrancy, access control, or arithmetic vulnerabilities found. Contract is secure against untrusted users."
