State updates precede external calls, preventing reentrancy. Total deposits match the contract's token balance, ensuring sufficient funds for withdrawals. The code assumes standard ERC20 behavior (reverts on transfer failure), and no unchecked return values lead to exploitable loss of funds without non-standard token assumptions or external manipulations, which are out of scope. No ownership privileges or trusted roles exist to abuse. The contract is secure against common vulnerabilities like reentrancy, integer overflows (Solidity 0.8+), or unauthorized access."
