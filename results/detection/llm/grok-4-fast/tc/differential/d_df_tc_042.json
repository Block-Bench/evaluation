However, no exploitable security vulnerabilities exist: reentrancy is prevented, balances are properly managed, withdrawals require sufficient balance, and admin-only registration assumes trusted admin. Unauthorized claiming via claimRewards depends on external market behavior, which is out of scope and not concretely exploitable without malicious external contracts. No loss of funds or unauthorized access possible without trusted role compromise."
