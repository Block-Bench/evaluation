Standard ERC20 functions are correctly implemented with implicit getters for public mappings. Vault functions handle collateral deposits, borrowing, repayment, and withdrawals with proper ratio checks using fixed 150% collateralization (100/150 LTV). State updates precede token transfers, preventing reentrancy. No oracle or liquidation exists, but this is a design choice, not an exploitable vulnerability. Integer division may cause minor precision loss, but does not enable over-borrowing or unauthorized access. Direct token transfers to the vault are not accounted for, providing unclaimed protocol collateral without user loss. No concrete attack paths exist for untrusted users to drain funds or manipulate state."
