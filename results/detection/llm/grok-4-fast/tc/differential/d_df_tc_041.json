Empty implementations (e.g., swapDebtParaSwap) and unused parameters (e.g., ids in claimReward) indicate incomplete functionality but no exploitable security issues. Admin controls (e.g., allowedPairs) rely on trusted roles, which are not considered vulnerabilities. No concrete attack paths exist for unauthorized fund loss or state manipulation without admin compromise."
