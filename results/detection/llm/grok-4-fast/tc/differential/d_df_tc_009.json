This renders the contract unusable for intended purposes, but no exploitable security vulnerabilities exist. Withdrawals require a non-zero supplied balance, which cannot be established without external token transfers to the contract. Even if tokens are mistakenly sent to the contract, no untrusted user can withdraw them without a supplied balance, preventing unauthorized access or fund loss. No reentrancy, access control, or manipulation issues are present, as state updates are protected by reverts and checks."
