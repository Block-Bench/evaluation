The _decodeTx function hardcodes a call to dataContract's onlyOwner-protected putCurEpochConPubKeyBytes with empty arguments, which would fail authorization even if allowed. No funds are handled, and no unauthorized state changes or executions are possible. The contract cannot perform cross-chain actions as intended but has no exploitable vulnerabilities."
