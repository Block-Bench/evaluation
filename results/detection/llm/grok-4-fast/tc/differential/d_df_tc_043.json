Minting is restricted to authorized minters via modifier, with supply cap enforcement. The setMinter function allows minters to add new ones, and multi-sig constants exist but are not enforced, representing a design choice rather than an exploitable vulnerability. No reentrancy, overflow (Solidity 0.8+), unauthorized access, or external attack vectors exist. Issues like potential malicious minter actions require trusted role compromise, which is out of scope."
