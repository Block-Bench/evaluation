The swapExactJarForJar function proxies calls to governance-approved targets but performs no jar interactions, rendering it non-functional for its intended purpose. However, no exploitable vulnerabilities exist: calls require whitelisted targets (governance-controlled), transfers in Strategy are restricted to the controller, and no unauthorized fund loss, access, or manipulation is possible without governance compromise. Issues like unused parameters or incomplete logic are design flaws, not security vulnerabilities."
