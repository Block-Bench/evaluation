However, no real exploitable security vulnerabilities exist: no funds can be lost or stolen, as the contract handles no assets. State manipulations (e.g., arbitrary userDeposits via mint without transfers) have no concrete impact, as borrowing is impossible and no withdrawal/liquidation logic exists. Lack of access control on addMarket and updateCachedPrice allows unauthorized configuration changes, but they do not enable loss of funds or unauthorized access due to the non-functional calculations. Oracle calls lack full validation in calculations, but irrelevant given zero power. Overall, safe from exploits despite bugs."
