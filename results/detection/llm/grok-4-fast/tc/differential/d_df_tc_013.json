It uses a reentrancy guard on transfer, performs state updates before external calls in burn, and handles pricing via share-based accounting. Potential concerns like direct ETH sends via receive() lead to unaccounted funds that remain stuck but do not enable exploitation or loss to other users. Integer truncation in pricing causes negligible dust loss (<1 wei per operation), not practically exploitable. No reentrancy, access control, or arithmetic vulnerabilities with concrete high-impact exploits exist."
