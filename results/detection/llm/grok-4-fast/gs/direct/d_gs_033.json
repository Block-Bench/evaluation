It lacks access control, allowing anyone to deploy, but this appears intentional for a public factory. No funds are held or manipulated in the factory itself. Deployment failures are handled via revert. No exploitable vulnerabilities exist: no reentrancy, unauthorized access, or state manipulation paths. Deterministic addressing via salt is a feature, not a flaw. Dependencies (interfaces) do not introduce issues in this context."
