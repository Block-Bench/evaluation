    "description": "in the `GaugeV2` contract, if the contract was emergency activated, users calling `emergencyWithdraw()` will lose all past accrued rewards that didn\u2019t have `updateReward()` called on it previously for a user to earn rewards, he gets his mappings updated here modifier updateReward(address account) { rewardPerTokenStored = rewardPerToken(); lastUpdateTime = lastTimeRewardApplicable(); if (account != address(0)) { rewards[account] = earned(account); userRewardPerTokenPaid[account] = rewardPerTokenStored; } _; } as we see above, rewards mapping is registered as the return data from `earned()`, and when we look at it we see function earned(address account) public view returns (uint256) { rewards[account] + _balanceOf(account) * (rewardPerToken() - userRewardPerTokenPaid[account]) / 1e18; } we see that it returns old rewards + current balance of the user multiplied by the rewardPerToken (abstractly) so what happen will be as follows: 1. User stake 100e18 tokens 2. emergency activated 3. he had already earnt before the emergency 10e18 tokens not registered on his rewards mapping since he didn\u2019t call deposit/withdraw/getRewards to update his rewards 4. call emergencyWithdraw and his balance now is 0. 5. now earned() function return 0 rewards since his balance is 0 * rewardPerToken = 0 also the left-off rewards tokens are stuck in the contract forever. Impact: Loss of rewards for users and stuck reward tokens in the contract",

Key functions like deposit, withdraw, and getReward are secured against reentrancy and include necessary validations. Emergency withdrawals respect balances due to checked subtractions. Reward distribution prevents overflows via balance checks. Maturity time is unused (defaults to 0, allowing immediate withdrawals), but this is a design choice, not an exploitable vulnerability. Fee claiming and bribe notifications assume trusted external contracts (IPair, IBribe, IRHYBR), but no untrusted exploits are possible. No real, exploitable vulnerabilities found requiring non-trusted compromise."
