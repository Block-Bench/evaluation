The for loop at lines 121-126 just pushes actions without checking targets. If the plugin's targetConfig is set to execute with delegatecall, actions targeting the LockManager will be executed on behalf of the plugin, allowing attackers to call proposalEnded() to remove active proposals from tracking.",

Alice calls unlock() - her NO vote is not cleared because proposal_1 isn't tracked.\n8. Alice withdraws tokens while her vote is still active on proposal_1.",

It correctly handles proposal creation, voting (via trusted LockManager calls), tallying, and execution with modes for early execution and vote replacement. Reliance on totalSupply for participation and approval thresholds is a design choice, not a vulnerability, as it encourages locking without enabling exploits. No reentrancy, overflow, or unauthorized access issues found. Permissions prevent untrusted interference, and logic enforces voting rules without exploitable gaps."
