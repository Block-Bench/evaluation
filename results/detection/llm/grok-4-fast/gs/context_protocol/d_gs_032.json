Static signatures are securely managed with expiration and caller checks, restricted to self-calls. Signature recovery delegates to BaseSig, with weight and imageHash validation. The recoverSapientSignature appends the caller to parentWallets for nested validation but returns a magic value (1) instead of the recovered imageHash, which mismatches the protocol's intent to recover the imageHash for parent verification. This is a logic error breaking legitimate nested signing but not exploitable for unauthorized access, as parent Merkle proofs fail mismatch and child self-validates the real imageHash. No concrete exploits for fund loss or state manipulation exist; trusted roles are secure, and no discrepancies enable attacks."
