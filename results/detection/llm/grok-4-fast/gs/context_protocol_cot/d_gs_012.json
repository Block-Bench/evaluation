Some ERC20 tokens like BAT, HT, cUSDC, ZRX do not revert when a transfer fails but instead return false.",

It correctly handles token transfers, tracks locked balances, and integrates with the trusted LockToVote plugin for voting and proposal management.

State changes precede external calls appropriately, preventing reentrancy exploits assuming the plugin is trusted. No logic errors, order-of-operations issues, or exploitable attack vectors were identified. Invariants (e.g., locked balances matching held tokens) are maintained, and economic manipulations are not feasible."
