    "description": "The currentTokenSupply() function at LockToVotePlugin line 249-251 returns IERC20(lockManager.token()).totalSupply(). This is used in threshold checks (isMinVotingPowerReached, isMinApprovalReached). For tokens like ERC4626 shares, flash-mintable tokens (DAI, WETH), or tokens with permissionless minting, attackers can manipulate totalSupply to skew voting thresholds. This is especially impactful during the last block of a proposal.",

    "attack_scenario": "1. A proposal is close to passing based on participation threshold.\n2. Attacker flash-mints large amount of tokens (e.g., via ERC4626 vault deposit).\n3. currentTokenSupply() returns inflated totalSupply.\n4. isMinVotingPowerReached() calculates: votes / inflatedSupply.\n5. Participation ratio appears lower than required.\n6. Proposal that should pass now fails.\n7. Attacker burns/withdraws the tokens in same transaction.",
    "fix_description": "Avoid using currentTotalSupply where it can be skewed. Consider recording totalSupply at proposal creation time. Document token compatibility requirements. Use conservative figures if supply changes significantly.",

    "overall_explanation": "The contract implements the intended Lock-to-Vote governance logic correctly. Proposal creation, voting via LockManager, tally updates, and execution follow the protocol's business model. Key functions enforce voting modes (standard, early execution, replacement), prevent invalid votes, and maintain invariants like non-decreasing power in non-replacement modes. No reentrancy risks due to proper state updates before external calls. The inverted permission check in _attemptEarlyExecution prevents early execution but does not enable exploits or unauthorized actions. Thresholds align with total supply. No logic errors, economic attacks, or discrepancies found."
