The for loop at lines 121-126 just pushes actions without checking targets. If the plugin's targetConfig is set to execute with delegatecall, actions targeting the LockManager will be executed on behalf of the plugin, allowing attackers to call proposalEnded() to remove active proposals from tracking.",

Alice calls unlock() - her NO vote is not cleared because proposal_1 isn't tracked.\n8. Alice withdraws tokens while her vote is still active on proposal_1.",

No reentrancy risks due to auth guards and state updates before externals. Participation/approval thresholds use current totalSupply without snapshot, discrepant from docs intending creation-time supply, but no concrete exploit without assuming malicious token supply changes (requiring trusted compromise). Other aspects align with intent; no logic errors, economic attacks, or unguarded state manipulations found."
