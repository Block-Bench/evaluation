    "description": "Staking.totalControlled() derives the mETH/ETH exchange rate inputs from oracle.latestRecord() without validating the record timestamp. If the oracle lags significant state changes (e.g., validator rewards or slashing), the resulting rate becomes stale. An attacker can exploit this by timing mint/burn operations against outdated totals: redeeming mETH for excess ETH when a slashing is not yet reflected (overstated totalControlled()), or depositing ETH to mint excess mETH when recent rewards are not yet reflected (understated totalControlled()), extracting value from other users.",

    "attack_scenario": "Slashing scenario:\n1. Validators are slashed, reducing the actual ETH controlled by the protocol\n2. Oracle has not yet updated to reflect the slashing\n3. totalControlled() returns the old (higher) value\n4. Attacker calls unstakeRequest() and receives more ETH per mETH than they should\n5. Other users bear the loss when the oracle updates\n\nReward scenario:\n1. Validators earn significant rewards\n2. Oracle has not yet updated to reflect the new rewards\n3. totalControlled() returns the old (lower) value\n4. Attacker calls stake() and receives more mETH per ETH than they should\n5. The mETH is worth more once the oracle updates",
    "fix_description": "Enforce freshness validation for oracle records when minting or burning mETH. The Oracle.latestRecord() function has no sanity checks - it simply returns _records[_records.length - 1]. The validations should be implemented on the caller side, specifically in the Staking.totalControlled() function.",

Key functions (stake, unstakeRequest) correctly handle ETH/mETH conversions using current totalControlled ETH, with atomic transfers preventing partial state changes. totalControlled accurately aggregates protocol ETH (unallocated, allocated, validators, liquidity, unstakes) via trusted external views. No reentrancy risks, as external calls (mint, transferFrom) follow checks-effects-interactions. Adjustment rate asymmetry acts as an intended staking fee. Missing functions (e.g., allocation, initiation) are not provided, but provided code maintains invariants without exploitable discrepancies. Assumes trusted oracle, roles, and interfaces."
