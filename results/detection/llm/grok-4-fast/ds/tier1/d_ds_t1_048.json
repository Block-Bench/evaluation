However, no real exploitable vulnerabilities exist that allow unauthorized fund loss, state manipulation, or access without compromising the trusted owner role. All sensitive operations are owner-restricted, deposits are safe from external drains, and no reentrancy or overflow paths enable external attacks. The issues are usability bugs or owner-action risks, not security exploits."
