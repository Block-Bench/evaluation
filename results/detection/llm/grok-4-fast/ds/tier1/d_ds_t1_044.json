Repeat reentrancy until the vault is drained (limited only by gas). 5. After reentrancy, the original call completes, setting balance to 0, but funds are already stolen.",

Modify withdrawBalance to: uint amount = userBalance[msg.sender]; userBalance[msg.sender] = 0; if (!msg.sender.call.value(amount)()) { throw; } This prevents reentrancy by zeroing balance first. Consider using transfer() for safety in 0.4.x, or upgrade to a newer Solidity version with require() and safer send methods."
