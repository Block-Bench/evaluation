Reentrancy attempts fail the second send (insufficient funds), triggering revert of the entire transaction, rolling back all changes including ETH transfer. No overflow risks as credits align with deposits. Direct ETH sends leave extra funds unclaimable but secure. No exploitable vulnerabilities for fund loss or unauthorized access."
