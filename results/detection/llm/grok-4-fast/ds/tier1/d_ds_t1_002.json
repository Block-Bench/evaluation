Attacker's fallback receives ETH and re-enters withdrawBalance(), withdrawing another 1 ETH (balance still 1 ETH). 6. Repeat reentrancy until TokenVault's balance is drained (limited only by gas).",
        "suggested_fix": "Update the balance to zero before the external call: Move 'userBalance[msg.sender] = 0;' before the if statement. Alternatively, implement a reentrancy guard (e.g., a locked state variable) or use transfer() instead of call.value() for safer sending in Solidity 0.4.x, though upgrading to a newer version is recommended for built-in protections."
