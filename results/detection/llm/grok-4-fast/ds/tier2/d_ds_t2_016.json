It holds no state, processes no funds, and has no access control or external interactions. While the calculation (price / 100 * discount) suffers from truncation due to integer division, leading to potential precision loss (e.g., for price=150, discount=10, returns 10 instead of 15), this is a functional inaccuracy, not a security vulnerability. No exploitable paths exist for fund loss, unauthorized access, or state manipulation, as required by analysis criteria."
