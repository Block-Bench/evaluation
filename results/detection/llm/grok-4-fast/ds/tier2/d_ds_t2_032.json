However, reverts ensure no unauthorized state changes or fund losses occur. Owner functions like `migrate_and_destroy` require trusted owner action and pose no untrusted exploit risk. No overflow issues due to explicit checks. Standard ERC20 functions are correctly implemented with allowances and balances protected. No real, exploitable vulnerabilities exist for loss of funds, unauthorized access, or state manipulation by untrusted parties."
