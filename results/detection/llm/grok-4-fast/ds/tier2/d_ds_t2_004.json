Deposits are strictly enforced (exact value, balance cap), and no receive/fallback allows direct ether sends, preventing bypasses. Claim uses low-level call to send all funds atomically, avoiding reentrancy since balance is depleted before any potential fallback execution. No paths to unauthorized access, fund loss, or state manipulation exist without trusted roles. The design assumes honest participation to reach the target, but no exploitable security issues."
