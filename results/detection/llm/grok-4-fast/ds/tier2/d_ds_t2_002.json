It only includes an owner-only ERC20 recovery mechanism, which is a standard, secure pattern for emergency fund retrieval and does not introduce exploitable vulnerabilities without owner compromise. The separate RewardToken contract is a basic ERC20 with initial minting to the deployer, posing no security issues. Overall, no real, exploitable vulnerabilities exist in the code as presented."
