Potential concerns like reentrancy in ether sends are mitigated because compensation (99% of claim price) is less than the claim price, preventing recursive claims. Unchecked send return values may leave ether in the contract if transfers fail, but the wizard can withdraw it via sweepCommission, which assumes trust in the wizard role. Arithmetic overflow in price calculation is theoretically possible after ~437 claims but practically impossible due to exponential cost growth exceeding global ETH supply. No exploitable vulnerabilities by untrusted parties exist; issues are either design choices or require trusted role compromise."
