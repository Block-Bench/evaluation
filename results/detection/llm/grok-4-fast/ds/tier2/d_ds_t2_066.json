Unchecked send() failure leaves funds in the contract but resets state, without a profitable untrusted exploit. Front-running by the second player to ensure victory is a game-theoretic issue, not a security vulnerability, as it follows intended mechanics with public state. Owner actions (e.g., withdrawing stuck funds) require trusted role compromise. No real, untrusted exploits for fund loss or state manipulation exist."
