If `cnt * _value` exceeds 2^256 - 1, `amount` becomes a small value. The subsequent balance subtraction uses this small `amount`, but the loop adds the large `_value` to each receiver, enabling the sender to lose minimal tokens while distributing massively more, inflating total balances beyond `totalSupply`.",

Call `batchTransfer` with `_receivers` array of 20 addresses (e.g., attacker's own or others) and `_value` set to `(2^256 / 20) + 1`. 3. `amount` overflows to ~20. 4. Balance subtraction deducts ~20 tokens from attacker. 5. Loop adds huge `_value` to each of 20 receivers, minting ~2^256 tokens total. Attacker can repeat to drain value from token.",
