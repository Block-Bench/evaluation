No exploitable vulnerabilities exist, as there are no mechanisms for loss of funds, unauthorized access, or state manipulation. Issues like unchecked `info.from` against `msg.sender` are irrelevant without minting logic. The hardcoded signer is a design choice, not a vulnerability without compromise scenarios."
