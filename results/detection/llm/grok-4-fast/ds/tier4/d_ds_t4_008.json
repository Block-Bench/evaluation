SimplePool implements a proportional share-based liquidity pool with correct deposit/withdraw logic using pre-transfer balance for share calculation, preventing front-running. Integer division floors shares/tokens, but due to the design (initial shares matching tokens, subsequent additions preserving equality), no rounding dust accumulates under normal conditions. State updates precede transfers, avoiding reentrancy. Assumes standard IERC20 compliance (full transfer amounts, returns bool); non-standard tokens (e.g., fee-on-transfer) could cause unfairness, but this requires non-standard deployment choice, not an exploitable flaw in the code itself. No concrete attacks without trusted misconfiguration."
