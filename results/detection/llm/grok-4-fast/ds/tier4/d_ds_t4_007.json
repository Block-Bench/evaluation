Ether sent directly (e.g., via selfdestruct) increases the contract balance without updating any user's balanceReceived, potentially leaving funds stuck. However, this does not enable unauthorized withdrawals, fund loss, or state manipulation, as withdrawals are strictly limited to the caller's recorded balance. No reentrancy, overflow, or access control issues exist. The design is secure for its intended purpose."
