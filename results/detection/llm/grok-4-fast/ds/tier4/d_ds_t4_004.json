No exploitable vulnerabilities were found. The flash loan requires full repayment in USDa before completion, preventing manipulation of the pool's balances for profit in the exchange. The exchange uses the pool's ratio but does not update pool liquidity, which is a design choice rather than a security issue. Calculations avoid division by zero, and standard ERC20 interactions are used without reentrancy risks. No unauthorized fund loss, access, or state manipulation is possible without trusted role compromise."
