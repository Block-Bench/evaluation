There are no access control checks in executeOperation, but this does not lead to exploitable fund loss, as the contract holds no intentional balances and direct calls to executeOperation revert without sufficient tokens due to SafeERC20. Flash loans execute correctly without reentrancy risks, and no unauthorized access or state manipulation is possible. Functional limitations (e.g., fixed receiver, no liquidity deposit mechanism) are not security issues. Trusted owner minting in USDa is by design."
