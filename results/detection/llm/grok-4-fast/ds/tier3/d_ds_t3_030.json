Analysis shows no exploitable vulnerabilities: randomness is secure against prediction or manipulation due to pre-commitment of secrets; fund accounting balances expected payouts with reservations; access controls rely on trusted roles (owner, bot, signer) without untrusted exploits; no reentrancy, overflow, or replay risks in untrusted paths. Design allows potential underfunding but prevents new bets and requires donations for recovery, without attacker-forced DoS. Old Solidity version lacks modern safeguards but no concrete issues arise."
