It uses Solidity 0.8.18's built-in overflow protection and the `transfer` method in withdrawal, which limits gas to 2300 and prevents reentrancy attacks. Access controls are properly enforced via `msg.sender`, and the `require` check ensures withdrawals do not exceed balances. No exploitable vulnerabilities, such as reentrancy, unauthorized access, or state manipulation, are present. The design is simple and secure for its intended purpose."
