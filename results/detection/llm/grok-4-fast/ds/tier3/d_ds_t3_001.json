This bricks the proxy post-deployment, as the fallback delegatecalls to address(0) and reverts on all interactions. However, this is a correctness issue, not an exploitable security vulnerability. No funds can be sent (fallback reverts), preventing loss of funds. No unauthorized access or state manipulation is possible by untrusted parties, as the contract has no functional endpoints and relies on the deployer (trusted) for setup. No other vulnerabilities found."
