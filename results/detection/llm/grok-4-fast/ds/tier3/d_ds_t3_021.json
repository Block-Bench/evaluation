However, no functions allow unauthorized fund drainage, token theft, or state manipulation by untrusted parties. Ownership transfer requires the caller's voluntary approval and payment, with no exploitable impact. ETH accumulates in the contract without withdrawal, but this is a design flaw, not a vulnerability. No reentrancy, access control, or arithmetic issues enable concrete attacks. Assumes standard ERC20 behavior."
