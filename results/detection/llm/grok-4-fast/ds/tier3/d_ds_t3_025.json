Other issues, such as asymmetric VC updates and lack of initial balance sum checks in VC init, rely on off-chain commitments and signatures, preventing concrete attacks by untrusted parties. No reentrancy, overflow, or access control vulnerabilities allow state manipulation or fund theft without trusted party involvement. The deposit function permits third-party contributions, but this is consensual and not exploitable maliciously."
