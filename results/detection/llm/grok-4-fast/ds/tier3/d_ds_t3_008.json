The mint function performs a pre-mint balance check to enforce the limit, uses sequential token IDs via totalSupply(), and employs OpenZeppelin's secure _safeMint. No reentrancy risks due to state updates before callbacks. Loop is bounded by the check (max 10 iterations). No unauthorized access, fund loss, or state manipulation possible. Unlimited total supply is a design choice, not a vulnerability. Contract is secure."
