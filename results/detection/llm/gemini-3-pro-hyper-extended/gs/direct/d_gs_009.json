        "explanation": "The contract implements a flash-vote protection mechanism using the `ownership_change` mapping. When an NFT is transferred, `ownership_change` is set to the current block number, and `balanceOfNFT` returns 0 for that block, preventing the new owner from voting immediately (e.g., via flash loan). However, the `merge` function allows a user to merge a 'tainted' NFT (one transferred in the current block) into a 'clean' NFT (one held previously or minted freshly). The `merge` function burns the source NFT and adds its value to the destination NFT but fails to update the `ownership_change` of the destination NFT. This allows an attacker to bypass the flash-vote protection by transferring a large veNFT and immediately merging it into another veNFT to vote in the same block.",
        "attack_scenario": "1. Attacker identifies a governance proposal closing soon.\n2. Attacker acquires a large veNFT (Token A) via a secondary market purchase or flash-loan-like mechanism. `_transferFrom` sets `ownership_change[Token A] = block.number`.\n3. `balanceOfNFT(Token A)` returns 0, so the attacker cannot vote directly with Token A.\n4. Attacker creates a new lock (Token B) with a minimal amount using `create_lock`. Token B has `ownership_change[Token B] = 0` (or old block).\n5. Attacker calls `merge(Token A, Token B)`. Token A is burned, and its locked amount is added to Token B.\n6. Token B's `ownership_change` is NOT updated to the current block.\n7. Attacker calls `vote` using Token B, utilizing the combined voting power of A and B in the same block, effectively bypassing the protection.",
        "suggested_fix": "In the `merge` function, update the `ownership_change` of the destination token to the current block number. This ensures that the resulting merged token is also subject to the flash-vote restriction.\n\n```solidity\n// Inside merge function, after updating locked[_to]\nownership_change[_to] = block.number;\n```\n\nSimilarly, if `multiSplit` is enabled, ensure new tokens also have `ownership_change` set to `block.number`."

    "overall_explanation": "The contract is a Voting Escrow implementation with delegation, merging, and splitting capabilities. It includes a specific security control (`ownership_change`) to prevent flash-loan attacks on governance. However, this control is incompletely applied. While transfers correctly trigger the lock, the `merge` function (and potentially `multiSplit` if enabled) allows users to move voting power from a restricted NFT to an unrestricted one without propagating the restriction. This vulnerability completely negates the flash-vote protection, allowing attackers to buy or borrow votes and use them within the same transaction/block."
