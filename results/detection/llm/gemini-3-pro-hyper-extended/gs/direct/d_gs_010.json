    "description": "The MinVotingPowerCondition contract allows any users who hold at least plugin.minProposerVotingPower() amount of tokens (locked in the LockManager or in their token balance) to create a proposal and execute LockToVote.createProposal. This logic can be easily bypassed if the token allows flashloan or flashmint. Given that isGranted checks the user's token balance (line 45: token.balanceOf(_who) + lockManager.getLockedBalance(_who)), the user does not even need to lock the flashloaned amount into the LockManager to be able to create and spam proposals.",

Change line 45 from 'token.balanceOf(_who) + lockManager.getLockedBalance(_who)' to just 'lockManager.getLockedBalance(_who)'.

        "explanation": "The contract calculates voting power by summing `token.balanceOf(_who)` and `lockManager.getLockedBalance(_who)`. This logic is flawed if the `LockManager` holds the locked tokens in custody (which is standard for locking contracts). If the user locks tokens, they transfer ownership to the LockManager. However, if the `LockManager` issues a receipt token or if the `token` variable refers to a token that tracks balances differently, this might be correct. But in the standard ERC20 + Locking contract pattern, `token.balanceOf(_who)` represents unlocked tokens in the user's wallet. The critical issue arises if the `LockManager` does *not* take custody but just tracks locked amounts, or if the user can flash loan tokens to inflate `balanceOf` while having a legitimate `lockedBalance`. More critically, if the `LockManager` is a staking contract where users deposit tokens, the calculation `balanceOf + lockedBalance` is correct for 'Total Power'. However, this check is susceptible to Flash Loan attacks. An attacker can flash loan a large amount of `token`, inflating `token.balanceOf(_who)`, pass the `isGranted` check (which is often used as a gatekeeper for proposal creation), and then repay the loan in the same transaction. Since `isGranted` is a view function called during permission checks, it reads the instantaneous balance.",
        "attack_scenario": "1. The DAO requires a minimum threshold of tokens to create a proposal (e.g., 100,000 tokens). \n2. An attacker holds 0 tokens and has 0 locked tokens.\n3. The attacker initiates a transaction that borrows 100,000 tokens via a Flash Loan from a liquidity pool.\n4. The attacker calls the target DAO contract to create a proposal. \n5. The DAO contract's permission system calls `MinVotingPowerCondition.isGranted(..., attacker, ...)`.\n6. `isGranted` checks `token.balanceOf(attacker)` which is now 100,000. The condition `100,000 >= _minProposerVotingPower` passes.\n7. The proposal is successfully created.\n8. The attacker repays the Flash Loan.\n9. The attacker has bypassed the governance threshold requirement without actually holding a stake in the protocol.",
        "suggested_fix": "To prevent flash loan attacks on proposal creation, the contract should check historical values (checkpoints) rather than instantaneous balances. Use `getPastVotes` or similar checkpointing mechanisms if the token supports ERC20Votes. If the token is a standard ERC20 without checkpoints, you cannot safely use `balanceOf` for governance gating in the same block. Alternatively, ensure the action being gated requires tokens to be locked or held for a duration, or use the `lockManager` exclusively if it enforces locking periods."
      }
    ],
    "overall_explanation": "The contract is vulnerable to Flash Loan attacks because it relies on the instantaneous `balanceOf` an ERC20 token to determine permission eligibility. In DeFi governance, checking current balances for proposal creation allows attackers to borrow the required voting power for the duration of a single transaction, create a proposal (spam or malicious), and repay the loan immediately. This bypasses the 'skin in the game' requirement intended by the minimum voting power threshold."
