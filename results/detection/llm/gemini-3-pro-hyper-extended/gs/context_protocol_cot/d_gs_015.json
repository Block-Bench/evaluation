The for loop at lines 121-126 just pushes actions without checking targets. If the plugin's targetConfig is set to execute with delegatecall, actions targeting the LockManager will be executed on behalf of the plugin, allowing attackers to call proposalEnded() to remove active proposals from tracking.",

Alice calls unlock() - her NO vote is not cleared because proposal_1 isn't tracked.\n8. Alice withdraws tokens while her vote is still active on proposal_1.",

The logic for 'Standard', 'EarlyExecution', and 'VoteReplacement' modes is consistent and prevents users from reducing their locked voting power while a proposal is active, ensuring the integrity of the vote. The reliance on the external LockManager and the DAO's permission system is handled via standard Aragon OSX patterns."
