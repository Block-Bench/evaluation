    "description": "When a wallet is behind a checkpointer and a chained signature is used with bit 6 (checkpointer usage flag) set to zero, BaseSig.recover skips the checkpointer validation block (BaseSig.sol:88-106). This leaves _checkpointer and snapshot unset (zero-valued). In recoverChained, the checkpointer is ignored, and the signature validation passes even if the checkpointer should be enforced. The final validation succeeds because snapshot.imageHash == bytes32(0) as the checkpointer is ignored.",
