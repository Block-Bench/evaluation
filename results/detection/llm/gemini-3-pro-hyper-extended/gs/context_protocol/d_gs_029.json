This prevents users from accidentally or maliciously delegate-calling into contracts that could self-destruct or manipulate storage in unintended ways, unless those contracts explicitly implement the Sequence extension interface.\n4. **Gas Griefing**: The explicit check `gasleft() < gasLimit` ensures that relayers cannot grief users by providing insufficient gas for sub-calls to force them to fail while the main transaction succeeds.\n5. **Authorization**: The `selfExecute` function is properly protected by `onlySelf`, ensuring it can only be invoked by the wallet itself (e.g., via a signed batch in `execute`).\n\nThe logic for `onlyFallback` and error handling behaviors (`IGNORE`, `REVERT`, `ABORT`) is implemented correctly according to the protocol description."
