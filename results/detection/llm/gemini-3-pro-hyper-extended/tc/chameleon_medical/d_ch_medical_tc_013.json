In the call, the attacker provides a value of 0 Wei for `msg.value` (actual payment) but manipulates the input corresponding to `msg.measurement` to be 100 ETH (e.g., 100e18).\n3. The contract calculates `issuecredentialQuantity` based on 100 ETH and credits the attacker's balance.\n4. The contract increases `totalamountAssetCapacity` by 100 ETH, even though no ETH was received.\n5. The attacker calls `archiverecordReceiverEther` to burn the fraudulently minted tokens.\n6.
