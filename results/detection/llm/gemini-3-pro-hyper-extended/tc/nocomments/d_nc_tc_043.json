Access control is correctly implemented for the minting functions using the `onlyMinter` modifier. The `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions correctly update balances and allowances. While the contract lacks some user-safety features (like preventing transfers to the zero address) and contains the standard ERC20 approval race condition, these are not considered exploitable security vulnerabilities in the context of a smart contract audit unless specific deviations from the standard are required."
