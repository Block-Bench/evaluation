The for loop at lines 121-126 just pushes actions without checking targets. If the plugin's targetConfig is set to execute with delegatecall, actions targeting the LockManager will be executed on behalf of the plugin, allowing attackers to call proposalEnded() to remove active proposals from tracking.",

Attacker creates proposal_2 with action: LockManager.proposalEnded(proposal_1_id).\n4. proposal_2 passes and executes.\n5. proposalEnded(proposal_1) is called via delegatecall from the plugin.\n6. proposal_1 is removed from knownProposalIds.\n7. Alice calls unlock() - her NO vote is not cleared because proposal_1 isn't tracked.\n8. Alice withdraws tokens while her vote is still active on proposal_1.",

The voting logic correctly implements different voting modes (Standard, EarlyExecution, VoteReplacement) with proper validation to prevent invalid state changes. The integration with the LockManager ensures voting power is properly tracked and validated. No exploitable vulnerabilities were identified in the provided code."
