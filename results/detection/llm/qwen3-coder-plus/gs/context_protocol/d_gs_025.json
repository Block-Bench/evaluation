The attack bypasses the normal withdraw() flow which goes through LiquidityBuffer",

The deposit function correctly wraps ETH to WETH then deposits to Aave pool with proper tracking. The withdraw function safely unwraps WETH back to ETH after withdrawal from Aave. Critical functions are protected by appropriate roles (EXECUTOR_ROLE for deposit/withdraw, MANAGER_ROLE for configuration, EMERGENCY_ROLE for recovery). The contract includes proper safety checks including requiring WETH as the only sender to receive ETH and preventing fallback calls. The liquidityBuffer address can only be changed by the manager role with proper role updates. No exploitable vulnerabilities were found in the implementation."
