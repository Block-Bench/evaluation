    "description": "The currentTokenSupply() function at LockToVotePlugin line 249-251 returns IERC20(lockManager.token()).totalSupply(). This is used in threshold checks (isMinVotingPowerReached, isMinApprovalReached). For tokens like ERC4626 shares, flash-mintable tokens (DAI, WETH), or tokens with permissionless minting, attackers can manipulate totalSupply to skew voting thresholds. This is especially impactful during the last block of a proposal.",

    "attack_scenario": "1. A proposal is close to passing based on participation threshold.\n2. Attacker flash-mints large amount of tokens (e.g., via ERC4626 vault deposit).\n3. currentTokenSupply() returns inflated totalSupply.\n4. isMinVotingPowerReached() calculates: votes / inflatedSupply.\n5. Participation ratio appears lower than required.\n6. Proposal that should pass now fails.\n7. Attacker burns/withdraws the tokens in same transaction.",
    "fix_description": "Avoid using currentTotalSupply where it can be skewed. Consider recording totalSupply at proposal creation time. Document token compatibility requirements. Use conservative figures if supply changes significantly.",

The contract correctly handles voting power updates, prevents double voting, enforces voting mode restrictions, and maintains accurate tallies. All critical functions are properly protected with appropriate permissions (CREATE_PROPOSAL_PERMISSION_ID and LOCK_MANAGER_PERMISSION_ID). The vote replacement logic correctly prevents invalid vote modifications, and the early execution mechanism safely checks both proposal conditions and caller permissions before execution. No exploitable vulnerabilities were found in the provided code."
