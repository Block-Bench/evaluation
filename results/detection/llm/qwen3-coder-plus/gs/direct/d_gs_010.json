    "description": "The MinVotingPowerCondition contract allows any users who hold at least plugin.minProposerVotingPower() amount of tokens (locked in the LockManager or in their token balance) to create a proposal and execute LockToVote.createProposal. This logic can be easily bypassed if the token allows flashloan or flashmint. Given that isGranted checks the user's token balance (line 45: token.balanceOf(_who) + lockManager.getLockedBalance(_who)), the user does not even need to lock the flashloaned amount into the LockManager to be able to create and spam proposals.",

    "fix_description": "Avoid using the token's balance and require the user to only use the locked amount. Change line 45 from 'token.balanceOf(_who) + lockManager.getLockedBalance(_who)' to just 'lockManager.getLockedBalance(_who)'. Store the proposal's creator in the proposal struct and require that the locked amount required to create the proposal won't be unlockable until the proposal ends.",

    "overall_explanation": "The MinVotingPowerCondition contract is a permission condition that checks if an account's voting power meets a minimum threshold. It correctly calculates the total balance by adding the token balance and locked balance, then compares it against the minimum required voting power from the plugin. The contract follows a simple, straightforward logic with no complex state changes or external calls that could introduce vulnerabilities. The function is marked as view and only reads from external contracts, making it non-manipulable through reentrancy or similar attacks. All external calls are to trusted interfaces that are part of the same system architecture."
