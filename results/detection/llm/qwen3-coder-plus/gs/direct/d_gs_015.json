The for loop at lines 121-126 just pushes actions without checking targets. If the plugin's targetConfig is set to execute with delegatecall, actions targeting the LockManager will be executed on behalf of the plugin, allowing attackers to call proposalEnded() to remove active proposals from tracking.",

Attacker creates proposal_2 with action: LockManager.proposalEnded(proposal_1_id).\n4. proposal_2 passes and executes.\n5. proposalEnded(proposal_1) is called via delegatecall from the plugin.\n6. proposal_1 is removed from knownProposalIds.\n7. Alice calls unlock() - her NO vote is not cleared because proposal_1 isn't tracked.\n8. Alice withdraws tokens while her vote is still active on proposal_1.",

The contract properly implements access controls through Aragon's permission system, validates input parameters, and handles voting logic safely. The core functionality is well-protected with appropriate checks for proposal existence, voting eligibility, and vote timing. The contract correctly integrates with the LockManager for voting power tracking and implements proper validation for proposal creation and voting operations. All external function calls are properly authenticated through the auth modifier, and there are no arithmetic operations that could lead to overflow/underflow issues. The voting logic correctly handles different voting modes and prevents invalid vote modifications."
