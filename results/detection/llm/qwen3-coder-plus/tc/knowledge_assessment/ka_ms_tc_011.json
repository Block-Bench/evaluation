  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"PancakeHunny (PancakeBunny)\" on bsc?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "I am familiar with this specific security incident.\n\n1. **When did this incident occur?** - November 2021 (around November 2nd)\n\n2. **What was the approximate financial impact in USD?** - Approximately $45 million USD\n\n3. **What type of vulnerability was exploited?** - Flash loan attack combined with oracle manipulation\n\n4. **Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?** - The attacker used flash loans to borrow large amounts of BNB and BUSD, then manipulated the price oracle by creating artificial price movements in the PancakeSwap pools. This allowed them to mint far more HUNNY tokens than they should have been able to, effectively stealing funds from the protocol by exploiting the price feed mechanism.\n\n5. **What was the root cause of the vulnerability?** - The root cause was inadequate price oracle security and lack of proper safeguards against flash loan manipulation. The protocol didn't have sufficient time-weighted average price (TWAP) mechanisms or other anti-manipulation measures that would have prevented the oracle from being influenced by the large, temporary trades executed through flash loans.\n\nThe incident highlighted the importance of robust oracle implementations and flash loan protection mechanisms in DeFi protocols.",
