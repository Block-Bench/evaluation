  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Inverse Finance Oracle Manipulation\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "I am familiar with the Inverse Finance oracle manipulation incident.\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\nThe incident occurred in February 2022.\n\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\nThe attack resulted in approximately $1.2 million in losses.\n\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited?\nOracle manipulation was the primary vulnerability exploited.\n\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\nThe attacker manipulated the price feeds by exploiting the fact that Inverse Finance was using Uniswap v2 TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) oracles that could be manipulated through large trades. The attacker used flash loans to manipulate the DAI/INV pool on Uniswap, causing the oracle to report artificially inflated prices for INV tokens. This allowed the attacker to borrow more assets than should have been possible against the inflated collateral value, then repay the flash loan and keep the excess borrowed funds.\n\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\nThe root cause was inadequate oracle design and implementation - specifically, the TWAP oracle was not properly configured or the time window was insufficient to prevent manipulation, combined with the protocol's over-reliance on a single exchange's price feed without proper safeguards against manipulation attacks.",
