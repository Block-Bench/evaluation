  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Alpha Homora Credit Account Manipulation\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "I am familiar with the Alpha Homora Credit Account Manipulation incident.\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\nThe incident occurred in March 2021, specifically on March 15, 2021.\n\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\nThe attack resulted in losses of approximately $38 million USD.\n\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? \nThe vulnerability involved oracle manipulation, specifically manipulation of the Uniswap V2 price oracles used by Alpha Homora.\n\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\nThe attacker manipulated the price oracles by making large trades on Uniswap V2 to artificially inflate the price of the underlying assets. This allowed them to borrow more funds than they should have been able to based on the actual market value. The attacker used flash loans to facilitate the manipulation and then exploited the inflated collateral values to extract excess funds from the Alpha Homora protocol.\n\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\nThe root cause was the protocol's reliance on Uniswap V2 spot prices as oracles without sufficient protection against price manipulation. The system used these spot prices directly for collateral valuation without implementing time-weighted average prices (TWAP) or other anti-manipulation measures that would have made such attacks economically unfeasible.",
