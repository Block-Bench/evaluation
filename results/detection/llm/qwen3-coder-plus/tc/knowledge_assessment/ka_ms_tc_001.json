  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Nomad Bridge\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "I am familiar with the Nomad Bridge security incident.\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\nAugust 2022\n\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\nApproximately $190 million\n\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited?\nLogic flaw/cross-chain messaging vulnerability\n\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\nThe attacker exploited a vulnerability in Nomad's cross-chain bridge messaging system. The bridge used a merkle tree to verify cross-chain transactions, and there was a flaw in how the bridge handled message verification. The attacker was able to send malformed messages that bypassed proper validation, allowing them to withdraw funds from the bridge without having deposited equivalent amounts on the other side of the bridge.\n\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\nThe root cause was a logic error in the bridge's message verification system. Specifically, there was an issue with how the bridge handled the \"home\" and \"replica\" contracts that coordinate cross-chain message passing. The vulnerability allowed attackers to forge message roots and bypass the normal deposit/withdrawal mechanisms, essentially printing tokens without proper backing.",
