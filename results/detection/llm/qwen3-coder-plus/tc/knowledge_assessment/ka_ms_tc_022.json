  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Hundred Finance Reentrancy\" on gnosis?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "I am familiar with this specific security incident.\n\nThe Hundred Finance reentrancy attack on Gnosis occurred in February 2022 (specifically around February 24-25, 2022).\n\n1. **When did this incident occur?** February 2022 (around February 24-25)\n\n2. **What was the approximate financial impact in USD?** Approximately $8 million was drained from the protocol\n\n3. **What type of vulnerability was exploited?** Reentrancy attack\n\n4. **Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?** The attacker exploited a reentrancy vulnerability in the xDAI bridge contract. The attack involved calling the deposit function multiple times before the previous calls completed, allowing the attacker to withdraw more funds than they had actually deposited by re-entering the contract during the execution process.\n\n5. **What was the root cause of the vulnerability?** The root cause was improper implementation of the reentrancy guard mechanism and failure to follow the \"checks-effects-interactions\" pattern. The contract allowed external calls to be made before all internal state changes were completed, enabling the reentrant calls that drained the funds.\n\nThe protocol was part of the xDAI (now Gnosis) chain ecosystem and the attack highlighted critical security issues in cross-chain bridge implementations.",
