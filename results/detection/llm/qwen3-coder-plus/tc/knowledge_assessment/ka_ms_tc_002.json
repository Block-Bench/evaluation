  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Beanstalk\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "I am familiar with the Beanstalk incident on Ethereum.\n\n1. **When did this incident occur?** April 2022 (specifically April 17, 2022)\n\n2. **What was the approximate financial impact in USD?** Approximately $182 million\n\n3. **What type of vulnerability was exploited?** Governance manipulation/flash loan attack\n\n4. **Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?** The attacker used flash loans to borrow large amounts of tokens, then used these to gain temporary control of Beanstalk's governance system through a governance proposal. They manipulated the governance process to pass a proposal that allowed them to steal funds from the protocol's treasury.\n\n5. **What was the root cause of the vulnerability?** The vulnerability was in Beanstalk's governance mechanism, which allowed a single entity to accumulate enough voting power through flash loans to control governance decisions temporarily. The protocol's design didn't adequately protect against governance attacks where an attacker could borrow sufficient tokens to gain voting control, execute malicious proposals, and then repay the flash loans - all within a single transaction block.",
