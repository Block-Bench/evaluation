When cash + totalBorrows is calculated, it overflows, wrapping to a small number 3. The subtraction of totalReserves then produces an incorrect totalUnderlying value 4. This corrupts the exchange rate calculation, allowing mint/redeem functions to be exploited",

The unsafe arithmetic `cash + totalBorrows - totalReserves` can overflow when totalBorrows becomes very large, corrupting the exchange rate and potentially allowing attackers to drain the contract through mints/redemptions at manipulated rates. This is a fundamental mathematical vulnerability that compromises the entire contract's value accounting system."
