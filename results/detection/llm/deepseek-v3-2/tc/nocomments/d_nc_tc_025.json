When depositing via transferFrom, the actual tokens received are less than the amount parameter due to the fee burned in DeflatToken at lines 26-31. However, the Vault records the full pre-fee amount in deposits[msg.sender] at line 50, creating an inflated ledger.",

User withdraws 100 tokens via withdraw(100), but Vault only holds 90. The contract either reverts (if insufficient) or, if later modified, could allow over-withdrawal draining other users' funds.",
        "suggested_fix": "In Vault.deposit(), record the actual received amount instead of the parameter. Calculate post-fee amount: uint256 received = amount * (100 - feePercent) / 100; deposits[msg.sender] += received; Or fetch post-transfer balance change via balanceOf checks."

    "overall_explanation": "The primary vulnerability is an accounting mismatch between Vault and DeflatToken due to the fee mechanism. DeflatToken itself has intentional burn-on-transfer semantics (design choice). The critical issue is in Vault assuming fee-less transfers, leading to incorrect deposit tracking. No access control or reentrancy issues detected. The vulnerability is concrete, exploitable, and can lead to fund locking or accounting insolvency."
