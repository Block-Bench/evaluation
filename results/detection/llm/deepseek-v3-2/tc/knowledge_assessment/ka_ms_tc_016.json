  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Qubit Bridge Zero Address Bypass\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "Yes, I am familiar with the Qubit Bridge exploit. Here are the details:\n\n1. **When did this incident occur?**  \n   The attack occurred on January 28, 2022.\n\n2. **What was the approximate financial impact in USD?**  \n   The exploit resulted in a loss of approximately **$80 million**.\n\n3. **What type of vulnerability was exploited?**  \n   The vulnerability was a **logic flaw** (specifically, a missing validation check) that allowed the attacker to bypass deposit requirements by using a zero address.\n\n4. **Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?**  \n   The attacker exploited the `deposit` function of the Qubit Bridge contract. By passing the zero address (`0x000...000`) as the deposit token address, the contract failed to validate whether the token was legitimate or whether any actual tokens were deposited. Despite depositing nothing, the bridge minted wrapped tokens (qXETH) to the attacker, which were then used to withdraw other legitimate assets from the bridge's reserves.\n\n5. **What was the root cause of the vulnerability?**  \n   The root cause was **insufficient input validation** in the bridge's deposit logic. The contract did not properly check if the deposited token address was valid or if the corresponding token balance increased after the deposit call. This allowed the zero address to be treated as a valid token, enabling the minting of wrapped tokens without any collateral.",
