  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Beanstalk\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "I am familiar with the Beanstalk Farms exploit on Ethereum.\n\n1. **When did this incident occur?**  \n   April 2022 (specifically, the attack transaction was executed on April 17, 2022).\n\n2. **What was the approximate financial impact in USD?**  \n   Approximately $182 million was taken (though some sources report around $76 million in immediate losses due to protocol-controlled liquidity being drained, with the rest in other assets).\n\n3. **What type of vulnerability was exploited?**  \n   The attack primarily exploited a **flash loan** combined with a **governance proposal vulnerability** (specifically, a flaw in the on-chain governance mechanism that allowed immediate execution of a malicious proposal).\n\n4. **Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?**  \n   The attacker used flash loans to borrow a large amount of assets (primarily BEAN and other liquidity pool tokens), which gave them enough voting power to pass a malicious governance proposal. The proposal contained code that would transfer protocol funds to the attacker\u2019s address. Because Beanstalk\u2019s governance allowed proposals to be executed immediately once they reached a quorum, the attacker was able to borrow, vote, pass, and execute the proposal within a single transaction (using the flash loaned assets for voting power), then repay the flash loans and keep the stolen funds.\n\n5. **What was the root cause of the vulnerability?**  \n   The root cause was a **design flaw in the governance mechanism**: Beanstalk used an on-chain governance system where proposals could be executed immediately upon approval, without a timelock delay. This allowed an attacker to use flash-loaned assets to gain temporary voting power, pass a self-serving proposal, and drain funds\u2014all within one transaction, eliminating the risk that the community could intervene or revert the action.",
