  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Inverse Finance Oracle Manipulation\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "I am familiar with this security incident.  \n\nHere are the details:  \n\n1. **When did this incident occur?**  \n   April 2022 (specifically, April 2, 2022).  \n\n2. **What was the approximate financial impact in USD?**  \n   About $15.6 million.  \n\n3. **What type of vulnerability was exploited?**  \n   Oracle manipulation (specifically, price oracle manipulation via a flash loan attack).  \n\n4. **Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?**  \n   The attacker used a flash loan to borrow a large amount of ETH, deposited it into the Curve Finance ETH/stETH liquidity pool to skew the pool\u2019s balance, and then manipulated Inverse Finance\u2019s oracle (which used the Curve pool\u2019s price) to report inflated prices for stETH and other assets. This allowed the attacker to borrow far more funds from Inverse Finance\u2019s lending platform than they should have been able to, and then they withdrew the borrowed funds, repaid the flash loan, and kept the excess.  \n\n5. **What was the root cause of the vulnerability?**  \n   The root cause was Inverse Finance\u2019s reliance on a single decentralized exchange (Curve pool) as the price oracle without sufficient safeguards (such as time-weighted average prices or multi-source price feeds) to prevent manipulation via large, temporary swaps.",
