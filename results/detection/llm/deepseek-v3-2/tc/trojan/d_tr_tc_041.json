During the low-level call, the malicious contract executes code that could re-enter the SmartLoan contract (if it had other functions) or perform other harmful actions. Since the call's success is not verified, the attacker could force a revert to block legitimate operations or exploit any reentrancy if other state-changing functions exist.",

Other functions like `upgradePool` have admin controls (requiring `admin` role) and do not pose direct exploitable risks without admin compromise. The `swapDebtParaSwap` function is a stub and safe. The factory's admin functions are intentional design choices, not vulnerabilities."
