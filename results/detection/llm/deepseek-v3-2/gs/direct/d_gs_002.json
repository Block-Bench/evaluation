    "description": "Governance can configure `DynamicSwapFeeModule` with fees up to 50%, but `CLFactory.getSwapFee` discards any value above 100_000 ppm (10%) and falls back to the tick-spacing default (often 500 ppm = 0.05%) without reverting or logging. Operators see the module reporting 20%, yet users continue paying the tiny default fee. The silent fallback misleads governance into believing higher fees are active. Impact - Governance believes a protective high fee is set (e.g., during launch anti-MEV), but the effective fee drops back to the default (e.g., 0.05%). - Traders are charged far less than intended, defeating protective or revenue objectives. - The misconfiguration has no on-chain signal, so the mistake can persist unnoticed. Root Cause - getSwapFee checks fee <= 100_000 ; larger values are ignored and the function returns tickSpacingToFee . - The module itself allows feeCap up to 500_000 (50%), so governance can set a value the factory immediately discards in favor of the default.",

    "fix_description": "Either revert when the module returns > 100_000 or raise the factory ceiling to match the module\u2019s cap. Emit events or add admin tooling to surface out-of-range configurations so operators can correct them. Hybra Finance mitigated: Added setMaxFee() function to make the fee cap configurable by the owner (up to 50%). This replaces the hardcoded limit and allows governance to adjust the maximum dynamic fee when needed.",
