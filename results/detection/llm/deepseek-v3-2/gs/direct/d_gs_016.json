If an address holds tokens but can't spend them due to being frozen or blacklisted (like USDC/USDT blacklist), they are still granted access to create proposals. The intended behavior should be to not allow calling createProposal as the tokens are not actually transferable.",

User calls createProposal().\n4. isGranted() at line 45 checks token.balanceOf(user) which returns 1000.\n5. User passes the minProposerVotingPower check despite having unusable tokens.\n6. User can spam create proposals without genuine stake in governance.",
