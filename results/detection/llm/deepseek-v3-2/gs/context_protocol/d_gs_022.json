However, when deposits come via `depositETH()`, funds are added to `pendingPrincipal`. If the contract's balance is drained separately (e.g., via `receiveETHFromPositionManager`), `address(this).balance` may be less than `amount`, but `pendingPrincipal` may still be high enough, causing the function to revert unexpectedly despite sufficient accounting allowance.",

This increases contract balance. Then a separate LIQUIDITY_MANAGER tries to allocate funds via `allocateETHToManager`. If the attacker withdraws the ETH (e.g., via a withdrawal), the balance is reduced, but `pendingPrincipal` remains high. Legitimate allocations fail due to insufficient balance check, disrupting protocol operations.",

However, there is a critical logic discrepancy in `_allocateETHToManager`: it incorrectly verifies against contract balance rather than relying on internal accounting (`pendingPrincipal`). This can lead to failed allocations when ETH balance is manipulated externally, disrupting core protocol functionality. Other functions follow secure patterns; no other exploitable vulnerabilities were found."
