    "description": "The MinVotingPowerCondition contract allows any users who hold at least plugin.minProposerVotingPower() amount of tokens (locked in the LockManager or in their token balance) to create a proposal and execute LockToVote.createProposal. This logic can be easily bypassed if the token allows flashloan or flashmint. Given that isGranted checks the user's token balance (line 45: token.balanceOf(_who) + lockManager.getLockedBalance(_who)), the user does not even need to lock the flashloaned amount into the LockManager to be able to create and spam proposals.",

Change line 45 from 'token.balanceOf(_who) + lockManager.getLockedBalance(_who)' to just 'lockManager.getLockedBalance(_who)'.
