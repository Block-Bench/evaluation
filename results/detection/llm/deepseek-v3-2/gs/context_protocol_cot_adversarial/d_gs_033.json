Since create2 forwards all Ether, this could drain ETH from the factory in a reentrancy loop. Attack 2: An attacker watches for legitimate deployment transactions in the mempool, extracts the salt and callvalue, then front-runs with a different _mainModule address to deploy a malicious wallet at the same deterministic address, potentially stealing funds sent to that address.",

        "attack_scenario": "An attacker could spam deploy wallets with random salts to waste gas and bloating contract creation logs.

The contract's use of CREATE2 with forwardable ETH creates a fundamental vulnerability that can lead to fund loss through either reentrancy or front-running attacks. The protocol's core premise of deterministic addresses for ERC-4337 wallets is sound, but the implementation lacks necessary safeguards. These vulnerabilities are not theoretical - they represent concrete attack vectors that could be exploited on mainnet. The contract requires significant modifications before deployment. Previous audit conclusions appear incomplete or incorrect given these clear security issues."
