    "description": "The currentTokenSupply() function at LockToVotePlugin line 249-251 returns IERC20(lockManager.token()).totalSupply(). This is used in threshold checks (isMinVotingPowerReached, isMinApprovalReached). For tokens like ERC4626 shares, flash-mintable tokens (DAI, WETH), or tokens with permissionless minting, attackers can manipulate totalSupply to skew voting thresholds. This is especially impactful during the last block of a proposal.",

    "attack_scenario": "1. A proposal is close to passing based on participation threshold.\n2. Attacker flash-mints large amount of tokens (e.g., via ERC4626 vault deposit).\n3. currentTokenSupply() returns inflated totalSupply.\n4. isMinVotingPowerReached() calculates: votes / inflatedSupply.\n5. Participation ratio appears lower than required.\n6. Proposal that should pass now fails.\n7. Attacker burns/withdraws the tokens in same transaction.",
    "fix_description": "Avoid using currentTotalSupply where it can be skewed. Consider recording totalSupply at proposal creation time. Document token compatibility requirements. Use conservative figures if supply changes significantly.",

    "overall_explanation": "The LockToVotePlugin contract implements a secure voting mechanism that delegates token management to a LockManager and permission management to the DAO. The voting logic correctly handles state transitions for both standard and vote-replacement modes. The strict checks in `_canVote` ensure that voting power cannot be manipulated or reduced without explicit actions (like `clearVote`), maintaining the integrity of the 'Lock-to-Vote' model. The contract correctly handles potential reentrancy via state checks and follows the checks-effects-interactions pattern. No exploitable vulnerabilities were found."
