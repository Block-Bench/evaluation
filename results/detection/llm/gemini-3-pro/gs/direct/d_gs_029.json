Session signatures are validated per-call using individual call hashes, enabling partial replay. Frontrunners can execute subsets of calls to grief or cause financial loss.",

It includes comprehensive security controls: 1) `delegatecall` is restricted to a specific selector (`handleSequenceDelegateCall`), preventing arbitrary code execution on untrusted contracts while allowing authorized extensions. 2) Gas limits are enforced via `gasleft()` checks to prevent relayer griefing. 3) Replay protection is handled via `Nonce` consumption. 4) Reentrancy is guarded. 5) `selfExecute` allows nested execution but is restricted to the contract itself. The logic for `onlyFallback` correctly handles error chaining. No exploitable vulnerabilities were found in the provided code."
