However, this check is insufficient due to the EIP-150 '63/64 rule'. When a low-level call is made, the EVM withholds 1/64th of the available gas. If `gasleft()` is exactly equal to or slightly higher than `gasLimit`, the check passes, but the actual gas passed to the sub-call will be roughly `gasLimit * 63 / 64`. This causes the sub-call to fail with an Out of Gas error despite the check passing. A malicious relayer can exploit this to force specific sub-calls to fail (triggering `CallFailed` or `CallAborted` instead of success) while ensuring the main transaction succeeds and the user pays for gas.",

The check `100,000 < 100,000` is false, so execution proceeds.\n5. The call is executed, but only receives ~98,437 gas (63/64ths).\n6. The sub-call fails due to Out of Gas.\n7. The error is ignored (per user config), the nonce is burned, and the user pays fees for a failed operation they explicitly tried to protect with a gas limit.",
