Crucially, it wraps the `send()` call in a `require()` statement. If a single transfer fails (returns `false`), the entire transaction reverts. `send()` can fail if the recipient is a smart contract that reverts in its fallback function or consumes more than the 2300 gas stipend forwarded by `send()`.",
        "attack_scenario": "1. The contract is deployed with `refundAddresses` containing a smart contract address that either has no `payable` fallback function or contains logic that reverts/consumes high gas.\n2. A user calls `refundAll()` to process refunds.\n3. The loop reaches the problematic address and executes `send()`.\n4. The recipient contract rejects the transfer (or runs out of gas), causing `send()` to return `false`.\n5. The `require()` statement detects the failure and reverts the entire transaction.\n6. The refund process is permanently blocked for ALL users, not just the failing one.",
        "suggested_fix": "Replace the 'Push' pattern with a 'Pull' pattern. Instead of sending funds in a loop, store the refund amounts in a mapping and create a `withdraw()` function that allows each user to claim their own funds individually. This isolates failures so one user cannot block others."

By strictly requiring the success of every Ether transfer within a loop, the contract creates a single point of failure. If any one of the hardcoded recipients is a contract that cannot accept Ether (or reverts), the entire refund mechanism becomes unusable, locking any funds associated with the other recipients."
