The `StakingRewards` contract acts as a token holder with a recovery mechanism restricted to the owner. While it imports OpenZeppelin's `Ownable`, it implements its own ownership logic, which is correctly secured by the `onlyOwner` modifier. The `recoverERC20` function allows the owner to withdraw funds, but this is a privileged action and not a vulnerability exploitable by attackers. Notably, the contract lacks actual staking logic (deposit/withdraw/claim), meaning there are no user funds at risk and no complex state transitions to exploit. The `RewardToken` is a standard ERC20 implementation."
