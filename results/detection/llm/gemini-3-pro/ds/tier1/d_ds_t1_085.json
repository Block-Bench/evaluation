        "explanation": "The function uses `msg.sender.send(amountToWithdraw)` to transfer Ether. In Solidity, `send` returns `false` on failure (e.g., if the recipient is a contract that runs out of gas) rather than reverting the transaction. The contract sets the user's balance to zero *before* attempting the transfer. If `send` fails, the execution continues, resulting in the user's balance being wiped out in the state mapping while the Ether remains locked in the contract.",
        "attack_scenario": "1. A user interacts with the contract using a smart contract wallet (e.g., a Gnosis Safe or a custom contract) that has a fallback function consuming more than 2300 gas.\n2. The user calls `withdrawBalance()`.\n3. The contract sets `userBalances[msg.sender]` to 0.\n4. The contract attempts to send Ether via `msg.sender.send()`. The user's fallback function triggers but fails due to the 2300 gas stipend limit imposed by `send`.\n5. `send` returns `false`, but the contract ignores this return value and finishes execution successfully.\n6. The user has lost their recorded balance but received no funds.",
        "suggested_fix": "Replace `msg.sender.send(amountToWithdraw)` with `msg.sender.transfer(amountToWithdraw)` (which automatically reverts on failure) or wrap the `send` call in a require statement: `require(msg.sender.send(amountToWithdraw));`. Note: In modern Solidity, using `call` with a check is preferred to avoid gas stipend issues, but for this specific vulnerability, ensuring the transaction reverts on failure is the key fix."

    ],
    "overall_explanation": "The contract contains a critical flaw in how it handles Ether withdrawals. While it correctly attempts to prevent reentrancy by updating the state before the external call (Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern), it fails to verify the success of that external call. Because `send` does not revert on failure, users with gas-heavy fallback functions or other transfer issues will permanently lose their funds."
