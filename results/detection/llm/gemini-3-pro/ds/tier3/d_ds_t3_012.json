The `Delegate` contract contains a public function `execute()` that sets `owner` to `msg.sender`. Since `delegatecall` executes the implementation's logic within the context of the proxy's storage, invoking `execute()` via the proxy writes directly to the proxy's storage slot 0. This allows any user to overwrite the `Proxy` contract's `owner` variable.",

The transaction data is set to the function selector of `execute()` (`0x61461954`).\n3. The `Proxy`'s fallback function receives the call and triggers `delegatecall` to the `Delegate` contract.\n4. The `Delegate` logic executes in the `Proxy`'s context, setting storage slot 0 (`owner`) to `msg.sender` (the attacker).\n5. The attacker is now the recorded `owner` of the `Proxy` contract.",

Because the `Delegate` contract exposes an unprotected function that modifies this variable, and the `Proxy` blindly delegates calls to it, any user can hijack ownership of the `Proxy` contract."
