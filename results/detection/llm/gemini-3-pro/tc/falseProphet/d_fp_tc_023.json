If the `permit` call fails (e.g., due to an invalid signature), the `catch` block suppresses the error, and execution proceeds to `_anySwapOut`. This allows an attacker to initiate a swap for any user who has previously approved the contract (allowance > 0) by providing invalid signature parameters. The contract fails to authenticate that the caller is authorized to move funds from the `from` address when the permit fails.",
        "attack_scenario": "1. Alice approves the `CrossRouter` contract to spend her tokens (e.g., USDC).\n2. Eve (attacker) calls `anySwapOutUnderlyingWithPermit` with `from` set to Alice's address, `to` set to Eve's address, and `amount` set to Alice's balance.\n3. Eve provides invalid `v`, `r`, `s` values (or zeros).\n4. The `permit` call at line 26 fails due to the invalid signature, but the empty `catch` block swallows the revert.\n5. The code proceeds to line 30, calling `_anySwapOut`.\n6. `_anySwapOut` uses `transferFrom` to move tokens from Alice to the contract (succeeding due to Alice's existing approval) and bridges them to Eve.",
        "suggested_fix": "Remove the `try-catch` block around the `permit` call. If a signature is provided, the `permit` must succeed to ensure authentication. Alternatively, if the function is intended to support cases without permit, enforce `require(msg.sender == from)` when the permit is not successfully executed."

The `anySwapOutUnderlyingWithPermit` function fails to properly validate the `permit` signature, allowing the call to proceed even if authentication fails. Because the function accepts an arbitrary `from` address, attackers can drain the wallets of any user who has approved the contract."
