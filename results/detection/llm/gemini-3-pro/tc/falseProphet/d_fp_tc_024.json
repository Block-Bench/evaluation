Consequently, the call to `IPair(pair).getReserves()` attempts to decode return data from an empty address, causing the transaction to revert in Solidity 0.8.0+. Additionally, the `swapExactTokensForTokens` function lacks any logic to transfer tokens from the user or to the recipient. While the contract contains severe logic errors (linear pricing formula, missing slippage checks, missing deadline checks), these are unreachable and unexploitable because the contract execution fails before they can be leveraged. A contract that always reverts or performs no state changes cannot be exploited to steal funds."
