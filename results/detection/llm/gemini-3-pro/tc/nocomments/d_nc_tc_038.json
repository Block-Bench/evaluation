This allows any external actor to call this function and mint an arbitrary amount of `SCT` tokens to any address. Since this token is intended to be used as collateral in the `CollateralVault`, this vulnerability allows an attacker to create infinite collateral value out of thin air.",
        "attack_scenario": "1. The attacker calls `CollateralToken.mint(attackerAddress, 1_000_000 ether)`. Because there is no access control, the transaction succeeds and the attacker receives the tokens.\n2. The attacker approves the `CollateralVault` to spend these newly minted tokens.\n3. The attacker calls `CollateralVault.addCollateral(1_000_000 ether)` to deposit the fake collateral.\n4. The attacker calls `CollateralVault.borrow(maxAmount)` to borrow `shezUSD` against the worthless collateral, effectively draining the vault's liquidity.",
        "suggested_fix": "Restrict access to the `mint` function. Inherit from an ownership contract (like OpenZeppelin's `Ownable`) and add the `onlyOwner` modifier to the `mint` function signature: `function mint(address to, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {`."

    "overall_explanation": "The analysis identified a critical access control vulnerability in the `CollateralToken` contract. The `mint` function allows unauthorized users to mint tokens, which destroys the token's economic security. When used with the `CollateralVault`, this allows attackers to mint infinite collateral and drain all lending liquidity (shezUSD) from the vault. The vault logic itself follows standard checks-effects-interactions patterns and appears safe from reentrancy, but the system is compromised by the insecure token implementation."
