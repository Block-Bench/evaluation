This allows any external actor to call this function and mint an arbitrary amount of `SCT` tokens to any address. Because `SCT` is intended to be used as collateral in the `ShezmuVault`, this vulnerability destroys the economic security of the lending system.",

The attacker calls `ShezmuVault.borrow(available_shezUSD)` to borrow all `shezUSD` held by the vault.\n5.

This flaw propagates to the `ShezmuVault`, allowing an attacker to drain all liquidity by depositing freely minted collateral. While there are minor deviations from best practices (e.g., missing events, Checks-Effects-Interactions violations in `repay`), the unprotected mint is the primary exploitable vector."
