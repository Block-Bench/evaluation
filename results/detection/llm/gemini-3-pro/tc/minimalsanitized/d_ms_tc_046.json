However, `playerBalances` (which tracks the total deposited) is incremented correctly. When `unlock` is called, it refunds only the value stored in `lockedAmount` (the most recent deposit) but resets the entire `playerBalances` to zero. This causes a permanent loss of funds equal to the sum of all prior deposits.",

Alice decides to add more funds and calls `lock(5 WETH, 1 days)`. The contract receives 5 WETH. `playerSettings` is overwritten: `lockedAmount` becomes 5. `playerBalances` becomes 15.\n3.

When a user calls `lock` multiple times (e.g., to top up their position), the contract overwrites the `lockedAmount` with the new deposit amount rather than adding to it. Since the `unlock` function clears the user's entire balance record (`playerBalances`) while only refunding the `lockedAmount`, any funds deposited prior to the last `lock` call are lost. The contract is otherwise standard, but this state management bug renders it unsafe for any user performing multiple deposits."
