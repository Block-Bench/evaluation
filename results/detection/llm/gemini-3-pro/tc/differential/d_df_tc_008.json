Specifically, the `withdrawAll` function correctly implements the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern by updating the state (setting `credit[msg.sender] = 0` on line 20) *before* performing the external call (line 22). This effectively prevents reentrancy attacks. Additionally, the contract uses Solidity 0.8.31, which has built-in overflow/underflow protection, ensuring the arithmetic operations on lines 13, 14, and 21 are safe. The `balance` state variable maintains a consistent accounting of the total deposited funds."
