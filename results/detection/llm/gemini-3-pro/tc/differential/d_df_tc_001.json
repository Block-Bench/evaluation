The `bridgeRouter.call` fails due to Out-of-Gas, returning `false`.\n5. The `BridgeReplica` transaction completes successfully, marking `M` as `Processed`.\n6.

By failing to revert the transaction when the underlying `bridgeRouter` execution fails, the contract allows an attacker to force a 'failed' state that cannot be recovered from (since the message is marked as processed). Additionally, the contract logic contradicts its documentation: it claims to verify Merkle proofs but actually only verifies that the message hash matches the `acceptedRoot` exactly. This effectively limits the bridge to processing one single pre-approved message at a time, rendering it functionally broken for batch processing."
