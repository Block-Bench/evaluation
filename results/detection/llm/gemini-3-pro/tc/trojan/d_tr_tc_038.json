The attacker calls `CollateralVault.borrow(availableLiquidity)` to borrow `shezUSD` against the free collateral, effectively draining the vault's funds.",
        "suggested_fix": "Restrict the `mint` function to authorized roles only. Inherit from `Ownable` (from OpenZeppelin) and add the `onlyOwner` modifier to the function signature: `function mint(address to, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {`."

    "overall_explanation": "The analysis identified a critical security flaw in the `CollateralToken` contract. The `mint` function is publicly accessible, allowing anyone to create tokens at will. This destroys the economic security of the token. Because this token is used as collateral in the `CollateralVault`, an attacker can exploit this to mint infinite collateral and drain all `shezUSD` liquidity from the vault. The suspicious variable names (e.g., `unsafeMintBypass`) appear to be distractors; the core issue is the missing access control on the state-changing mint function."
