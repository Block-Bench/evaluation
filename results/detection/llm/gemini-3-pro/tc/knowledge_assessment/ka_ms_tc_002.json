  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Beanstalk\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "Yes, I am familiar with the security exploit involving Beanstalk Farms on Ethereum.\n\nHere are the details regarding the incident:\n\n**1. When did this incident occur?**\nThe incident occurred on **April 17, 2022**.\n\n**2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?**\nThe protocol suffered a loss of approximately **$182 million USD**. (The attacker netted roughly $76 million after repaying flash loans and swapping tokens, but the total value drained from the protocol was ~$182 million).\n\n**3. What type of vulnerability was exploited?**\nThis was a **Governance Attack** facilitated by a **Flash Loan**.\n\n**4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?**\nThe attack proceeded in the following steps:\n1.  The attacker took out a massive flash loan (borrowing nearly $1 billion in assets from Aave).\n2.  They used these funds to acquire a controlling stake (67%+) of the project's governance tokens (Stalk).\n3.  The attacker proposed a malicious governance update (BIP-18) which was written to transfer the protocol's funds to their own address.\n4.  Using their flash-loaned voting power, they voted to pass the proposal immediately.\n5.  Once the proposal executed, the funds were transferred to the attacker.\n6.  The attacker repaid the flash loan and laundered the remaining profits via Tornado Cash.\n\n**5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?**\nThe root cause was a flaw in the **governance mechanism design**. The protocol allowed for an \"emergency commit\" execution of proposals if a supermajority (67%) of votes was reached. Crucially, the protocol did not implement a time-lock or a snapshot mechanism to prevent flash loans from being used to calculate voting power. This allowed the attacker to borrow voting power, execute a proposal, and return the voting power all within a single transaction block.",
