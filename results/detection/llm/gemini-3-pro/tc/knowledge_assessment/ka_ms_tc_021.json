  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Inverse Finance Oracle Manipulation\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "Yes, I am familiar with this incident. There have been two notable exploits of Inverse Finance, but the major incident specifically characterized as \"Oracle Manipulation\" involving the INV token occurred in April 2022.\n\nHere are the details regarding that specific incident:\n\n**1. When did this incident occur?**\nThe incident occurred on **April 2, 2022**.\n\n**2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?**\nThe approximate financial impact was **$15.6 million USD**.\n\n**3. What type of vulnerability was exploited?**\nThe primary vulnerability was **Price Oracle Manipulation**, facilitated by a **Flash Loan**.\n\n**4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?**\nThe attack followed these general steps:\n1.  The attacker took out a massive flash loan in Ethereum (ETH).\n2.  They used these funds to buy a significant amount of INV tokens on the SushiSwap INV-ETH liquidity pool.\n3.  This massive purchase drastically skewed the ratio of assets in the pool, artificially inflating the price of the INV token on SushiSwap.\n4.  Inverse Finance used a TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) oracle provided by Keep3r that relied on this specific SushiSwap pool to determine the price of INV.\n5.  Once the oracle updated to reflect the inflated price, the attacker deposited their INV tokens into Inverse Finance's lending market (Anchor) as collateral.\n6.  Because the protocol \"believed\" the INV tokens were worth much more than their actual market value, the attacker was able to borrow other assets (such as DOLA, ETH, WBTC, and YFI) far exceeding the true value of their collateral.\n7.  The attacker effectively abandoned the collateral and kept the borrowed funds.\n\n**5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?**\nThe root cause was the protocol's reliance on a price oracle derived from a **single liquidity pool with insufficient depth (liquidity)** relative to the capital available via flash loans. While the protocol used a TWAP oracle (which is generally safer than a spot price oracle), the window was short enough and the liquidity low enough that the attacker could manipulate the price significantly within a single transaction block to exploit the lending logic.",
