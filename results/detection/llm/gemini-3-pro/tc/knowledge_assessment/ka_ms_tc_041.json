  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"DeltaPrime\" on arbitrum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "Yes, I am familiar with the security incident involving DeltaPrime on Arbitrum.\n\nHere are the details regarding the incident:\n\n1.  **When did this incident occur?**\n    The incident occurred on **September 16, 2024**.\n\n2.  **What was the approximate financial impact in USD?**\n    The approximate financial impact was **$6 million USD** (specifically around $5.98 million).\n\n3.  **What type of vulnerability was exploited?**\n    This was an **Access Control / Private Key Compromise** incident. It was not a flaw in the smart contract logic itself (like reentrancy), but rather a compromise of the privileged administrative wallet.\n\n4.  **Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?**\n    The attacker gained control of the DeltaPrime admin wallet. With this administrative access, the attacker pointed the protocol's proxy contracts (specifically the `PrimeAccount` contracts) to a malicious implementation contract. Once the proxy was upgraded to the malicious code, the attacker was able to drain the funds deposited in the protocol.\n\n5.  **What was the root cause of the vulnerability?**\n    The root cause was the **leak or theft of the private key** associated with the protocol's admin wallet. This allowed the attacker to authorize malicious upgrades to the protocol without needing to exploit a code bug.",
