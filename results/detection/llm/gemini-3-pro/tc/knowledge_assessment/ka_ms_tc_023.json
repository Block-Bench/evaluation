  "response": "Yes, I am familiar with the Anyswap (now Multichain) V3 router exploit involving the permit bypass.\n\nHere are the details regarding that incident:\n\n**1. When did this incident occur?**\nThe incident occurred in **July 2021** (specifically around July 11, 2021).\n\n**2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?**\nThe approximate financial impact was **$7.9 million USD** (mostly in USDC and MIM).\n\n**3. What type of vulnerability was exploited?**\nThis was a **Logic Error / Improper Signature Verification** vulnerability. Specifically, it was a failure to properly validate the parameters of the `permit` function for tokens that did not natively support EIP-2612 (the permit standard).\n\n**4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?**\nThe attacker targeted the Anyswap V3 Router's `anySwapOutUnderlyingWithPermit` function. This function was designed to allow users to approve and swap tokens in a single transaction using a signature (permit).\n\nThe attacker noticed that if the underlying token being swapped did *not* implement the `permit` function natively, the router code did not revert the transaction or fail. Instead, it ignored the invalid signature parameters and proceeded to the next line of code, which executed a standard `transferFrom`.\n\nBecause many users had previously granted \"infinite approval\" (unlimited allowance) to the Anyswap Router to spend their tokens, the attacker was able to call this function for those users. The router, bypassing the signature check, used the pre-existing allowance to transfer the victims' tokens to the attacker's address.\n\n**5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?**\nThe root cause was a flaw in the router's control flow. The code assumed that if `anySwapOutUnderlyingWithPermit` was called, the underlying token would handle the signature verification. It failed to check if the token actually supported the `permit` standard. Consequently, for non-permit tokens, the signature verification was effectively skipped, allowing the function to act as an unauthorized `transferFrom` call for any user with an active allowance.",
