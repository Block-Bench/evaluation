  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Munchables\" on blast?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "Yes, I am familiar with the security incident involving Munchables on the Blast network.\n\nHere are the details regarding the incident:\n\n1.  **When did this incident occur?**\n    The incident occurred on **March 26, 2024**.\n\n2.  **What was the approximate financial impact in USD?**\n    The approximate financial impact was **$62.5 million USD** (17,400 ETH).\n    *Note: The funds were eventually returned by the attacker shortly after the incident.*\n\n3.  **What type of vulnerability was exploited?**\n    This was primarily an **Insider Threat / Social Engineering** exploit involving **Access Control** manipulation. It was not a technical flaw in the code logic (like reentrancy), but rather a malicious action taken by a developer with privileged access.\n\n4.  **Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?**\n    The attack was perpetrated by one of the project's own developers (who went by the GitHub username \"Werewolves0943\"). This developer manipulated the storage slots of the project's upgradeable proxy contract. By manually editing the storage implementation, the developer assigned themselves a massive balance of Ether that had been deposited by users. Once the balance was assigned to their address in the contract's state, they simply withdrew the funds.\n\n5.  **What was the root cause of the vulnerability?**\n    The root cause was **Operational Security (OpSec) failure** and **Centralization Risk**. The Munchables team had hired a developer (allegedly linked to North Korean hackers) without sufficient background checks. Furthermore, the project granted this developer excessive privileges, allowing them to upgrade contracts or manipulate contract storage without a time-lock or sufficient multi-signature oversight to prevent the immediate theft.",
