  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Radiant Capital Rounding Exploit\" on arbitrum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "Yes, I am familiar with the Radiant Capital rounding exploit that occurred on the Arbitrum network.\n\nHere are the details regarding that specific incident:\n\n**1. When did this incident occur?**\nThe incident occurred on **January 3, 2024**.\n\n**2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?**\nThe protocol lost approximately **$4.5 million USD** (roughly 1,900 ETH at the time).\n\n**3. What type of vulnerability was exploited?**\nThe vulnerability was a **rounding error (precision loss)** issue, specifically related to the manipulation of the exchange rate (liquidity index) in a newly initialized lending market.\n\n**4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?**\nThe attack targeted a newly activated native USDC market on Radiant Capital. The attacker exploited a time window immediately after the market was deployed but before significant liquidity was added.\n1. The attacker took out a flash loan.\n2. They manipulated the `liquidityIndex` (the exchange rate between the underlying asset and the protocol's receipt tokens, rTokens) to an extremely high value.\n3. By repeatedly executing `deposit()` and `withdraw()` functions with specific amounts, the attacker exploited a rounding flaw in the protocol's math.\n4. This rounding error allowed the attacker to inflate their own balance of shares, eventually allowing them to drain the funds accumulated in the pool.\n\n**5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?**\nThe root cause was a **known rounding issue present in Compound/Aave v2 forks**. The vulnerability exists when a lending market has extremely low liquidity (or is empty). The protocol failed to implement a safeguard\u2014such as burning the first small amount of liquidity tokens (often called \"dead shares\") or enforcing a minimum deposit limit\u2014which would have prevented the attacker from manipulating the share-to-asset exchange rate to such an extreme degree during the market's initialization.",
