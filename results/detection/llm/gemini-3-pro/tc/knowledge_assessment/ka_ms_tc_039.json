  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Hedgey Finance\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "Yes, I am familiar with the security incident involving Hedgey Finance.\n\nHere are the details regarding the exploit:\n\n**1. When did this incident occur?**\nThe incident occurred on **April 19, 2024**.\n\n**2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?**\nThe total loss was approximately **$44.7 million USD**. The exploit affected contracts on both the Ethereum mainnet and the Arbitrum network.\n\n**3. What type of vulnerability was exploited?**\nThe vulnerability is classified as **missing input validation** which led to an **access control** failure. Specifically, it allowed for unauthorized token approvals.\n\n**4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?**\nThe attacker targeted the `ClaimCampaigns` contract. They exploited the `createLockedCampaign` function. By calling this function with carefully crafted parameters, the attacker was able to trick the contract into granting them an allowance (approval) to spend the tokens held within the contract. Once the attacker obtained this spending allowance, they simply executed `transferFrom` calls to drain the tokens from the contract to their own address.\n\n**5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?**\nThe root cause was that the `createLockedCampaign` function lacked necessary validation checks. It did not verify that the tokens being \"locked\" or the campaign being created were legitimately funded by the caller in a way that warranted a token approval from the contract. The code blindly approved the transfer of tokens to the campaign manager (the attacker) without ensuring the contract actually owed those tokens to that specific campaign context.",
