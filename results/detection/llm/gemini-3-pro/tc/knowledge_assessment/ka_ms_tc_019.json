  "response": "Yes, I am familiar with the Uranium Finance security incident on the Binance Smart Chain.\n\nHere are the details regarding the incident:\n\n**1. When did this incident occur?**\nThe incident occurred in **April 2021** (specifically around April 28, 2021).\n\n**2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?**\nThe approximate financial impact was **$50 million USD**.\n\n**3. What type of vulnerability was exploited?**\nThe vulnerability was a **logic error** (specifically an arithmetic/math error) within the Automated Market Maker (AMM) swap function.\n\n**4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?**\nUranium Finance was a fork of Uniswap V2. The developers intended to change the fee structure of the protocol. To do this, they modified the `swap` function in the smart contract. However, they introduced a discrepancy in the math used to verify the \"constant product formula\" (x * y = k).\n\nBecause of this error, the contract miscalculated the required ending balances of the liquidity pool after a swap. The attacker was able to swap a very small amount of input tokens for a massive amount of output tokens (draining the pool) because the broken formula validated the trade as legitimate.\n\n**5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?**\nThe root cause was a **coding error involving hardcoded constants**.\n\nWhen the developers updated the code to support a 0.20% fee (instead of Uniswap's standard 0.30%), they increased the precision of the denominator from `1000` to `10000`. However, in the line of code responsible for checking the invariant (ensuring the reserves remain balanced), they forgot to update the multiplier for the balance from `1000` to `10000`.\n\nSpecifically, the code read:\n`balance0Adjusted = balance0.mul(1000)...`\nInstead of:\n`balance0Adjusted = balance0.mul(10000)...`\n\nThis order-of-magnitude error meant the condition checking the pool's reserves was satisfied even when the attacker removed almost all the liquidity.",
