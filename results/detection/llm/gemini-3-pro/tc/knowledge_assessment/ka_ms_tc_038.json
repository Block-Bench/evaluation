  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Shezmu Protocol\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "Yes, I am familiar with the security incident involving the Shezmu Protocol.\n\nHere are the details regarding the incident:\n\n1.  **When did this incident occur?**\n    The incident occurred on **September 20, 2024**.\n\n2.  **What was the approximate financial impact in USD?**\n    The initial loss was approximately **$4.9 million USD**. However, following negotiations, the attacker returned the majority of the funds, keeping roughly 10% as a white hat bounty.\n\n3.  **What type of vulnerability was exploited?**\n    The vulnerability was a **logic error** related to **improper input validation** (specifically regarding collateral verification).\n\n4.  **Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?**\n    The attacker exploited a flaw in the ShezmuUSD (ShezUSD) vault contract. The vulnerability allowed the attacker to call a function to mint ShezUSD stablecoins without depositing the required collateral. Once the unbacked ShezUSD tokens were minted, the attacker swapped them for other assets (such as WETH) in the protocol's liquidity pools, draining the funds.\n\n5.  **What was the root cause of the vulnerability?**\n    The root cause was a missing or flawed validation check in the smart contract's minting logic. The code failed to verify that the user had actually deposited the specific collateral asset before allowing the execution of the mint function, effectively allowing free minting of the token.",
