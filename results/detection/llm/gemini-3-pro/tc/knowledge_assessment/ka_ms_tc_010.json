  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Rari Capital Fuse\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "Yes, I am familiar with the major security exploit involving Rari Capital's Fuse pools.\n\nHere are the details regarding the incident:\n\n**1. When did this incident occur?**\nThe incident occurred on **April 30, 2022**.\n\n**2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?**\nThe approximate financial impact was **$80 million USD**.\n\n**3. What type of vulnerability was exploited?**\nThe vulnerability exploited was a **Reentrancy** attack.\n\n**4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?**\nThe attack targeted the interaction between the lending protocol's Comptroller contract and the handling of ETH.\n1. The attacker deposited collateral into a Fuse pool.\n2. The attacker called the `exitMarket` function to withdraw their collateral.\n3. When the contract sent ETH back to the attacker, it triggered the attacker's malicious contract's `fallback` function.\n4. Inside the `fallback` function, the attacker re-entered the contract and called the `borrow` function.\n5. Because the `exitMarket` function had not yet updated the internal state to reflect that the collateral was being removed, the protocol believed the attacker still held valid collateral.\n6. The attacker was able to borrow funds against the collateral they were in the process of withdrawing, effectively stealing funds from the pool.\n\n**5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?**\nThe root cause was a failure to adhere to the **Checks-Effects-Interactions** pattern within the `exitMarket` function of the Comptroller contract (a fork of Compound). The contract performed an external interaction (transferring ETH) before updating its internal state (marking the market as exited). Additionally, the specific function lacked a reentrancy guard, allowing the malicious callback to execute before the state update was finalized.",
