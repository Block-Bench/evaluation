  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Gamma Strategies Hypervisor\" on arbitrum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "Yes, I am familiar with the security incident involving Gamma Strategies on Arbitrum.\n\nHere are the details regarding the incident:\n\n**1. When did this incident occur?**\nThe incident occurred on **January 4, 2024**.\n\n**2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?**\nThe approximate financial impact was **$3.4 million USD** (specifically, the attacker drained approximately 1,535 ETH).\n\n**3. What type of vulnerability was exploited?**\nThe vulnerability was a **logic error** related to the calculation of share values, which was exploited via a **Flash Loan attack** (price manipulation).\n\n**4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?**\nThe attacker utilized a flash loan to manipulate the price ratio of the assets in the underlying Uniswap V3 pool. By skewing the ratio of the tokens, the attacker was able to deposit funds into the Gamma Hypervisor vault at a manipulated rate. Because the vault calculated the number of shares to mint based on this skewed ratio, the attacker received a disproportionately large number of liquidity shares. The attacker then repaid the flash loan (restoring the price) and withdrew their shares, draining the vault of its underlying assets.\n\n**5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?**\nThe root cause was a flaw in the **deposit mechanism** of the Hypervisor contract. It allowed users to deposit and mint shares based on the current, manipulatable spot ratio of the assets without sufficient checks (such as slippage protection or a \"deposit guard\" to prevent deposits during extreme volatility). This allowed the attacker to exploit the difference between the manipulated pool state and the vault's internal accounting.",
