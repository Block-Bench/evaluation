  "response": "Yes, I am familiar with the security incident involving Sonne Finance on Optimism.\n\nHere are the details regarding the incident:\n\n**1. When did this incident occur?**\nThe incident occurred on **May 14, 2024**.\n\n**2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?**\nThe approximate financial impact was **$20 million USD**.\n\n**3. What type of vulnerability was exploited?**\nThe vulnerability was a **precision loss / rounding error** issue, specifically known as the **\"empty market donation attack\"** (or exchange rate inflation attack) common to Compound V2 forks.\n\n**4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?**\nThe attack targeted newly created markets on the Sonne Finance platform (specifically for VELO and SoVELO). Because these markets were empty (had no prior liquidity), the attacker was able to manipulate the exchange rate between the underlying asset and the protocol's share token (c-token).\n\nThe attacker executed the following steps:\n1.  They minted a tiny amount of share tokens (the smallest possible unit).\n2.  They \"donated\" a large amount of the underlying asset directly to the market contract without minting new shares.\n3.  Because the exchange rate is calculated as `(Total Cash + Total Borrows - Total Reserves) / Total Supply`, and the Total Supply was miniscule, the donation caused the price of the share token to skyrocket mathematically.\n4.  The attacker then used their tiny amount of now massively overvalued share tokens as collateral to borrow other assets from the protocol, effectively draining the liquidity.\n\n**5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?**\nThe root cause was **improper initialization of new markets**.\n\nSonne Finance is a fork of Compound V2. It is a known requirement for Compound V2 forks that when a new market is listed, the administrator must either mint and burn a small amount of liquidity (to prevent the Total Supply from being low enough to manipulate) or ensure the market creation and collateral factor settings are handled in a way that prevents interaction until liquidity is safe. Sonne Finance added the new markets without this initial \"dead\" liquidity buffer, leaving them open to the donation attack immediately upon creation.",
