  "response": "Yes, I am familiar with the security incident involving Wise Lending on Ethereum.\n\nHere are the details regarding the incident:\n\n1.  **When did this incident occur?**\n    The incident occurred on **January 12, 2024**.\n\n2.  **What was the approximate financial impact in USD?**\n    The approximate financial impact was **$464,000 USD** (approximately 177 ETH at the time).\n\n3.  **What type of vulnerability was exploited?**\n    The vulnerability was a **Precision Loss / Rounding Error** issue, specifically a variation of the \"empty pool inflation\" or share price manipulation attack, facilitated by a flash loan.\n\n4.  **Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?**\n    The attacker used a flash loan to manipulate the exchange rate of the PLEND (Pendle) lending pool. The attack followed these general steps:\n    *   The attacker deposited a very small amount of assets into an effectively empty or low-liquidity pool to mint shares.\n    *   They then \"donated\" (transferred directly without minting shares) a large amount of assets to the pool. This drastically inflated the share price (the ratio of assets to shares).\n    *   Because of the inflated share price, the protocol's calculations for shares-to-assets suffered from precision loss (rounding errors).\n    *   The attacker exploited this rounding error to withdraw more assets than they were entitled to, effectively draining the lending pool.\n\n5.  **What was the root cause of the vulnerability?**\n    The root cause was the **improper handling of share price calculations** in a low-liquidity scenario. The protocol did not have a mechanism (such as burning the first mint of shares or a minimum liquidity threshold) to prevent an attacker from manipulating the `totalAssets` to `totalSupply` ratio to extreme levels, which induced the rounding errors necessary for the exploit.",
