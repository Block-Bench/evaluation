When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "Yes, I am familiar with the Belt Finance Strategy Exploit that occurred on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC).\n\nHere are the details regarding the incident:\n\n**1. When did this incident occur?**\nThe incident occurred on **May 29, 2021**.\n\n**2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?**\nThe attacker profited approximately **$6.2 million USD**. The total loss to the protocol was roughly $6.23 million.\n\n**3. What type of vulnerability was exploited?**\nThis was a **Flash Loan attack** that exploited a **logic error in the price calculation** (specifically related to the \"Elipsis\" strategy integration).\n\n**4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?**\nThe attacker executed the following steps:\n1.  They took out a massive flash loan of BUSD.\n2.  They deposited funds into the BeltBUSD strategy, which utilizes the Ellipsis (a Curve fork) pool as a backend.\n3.  They performed a large swap in the underlying Ellipsis pool to create a severe imbalance in the pool's token ratios.\n4.  Due to the imbalance, the Belt Finance strategy miscalculated the value of the LP tokens. The strategy assumed the value of the tokens was higher than they actually were in that unbalanced state.\n5.  The attacker withdrew their position. Because the strategy overvalued the holdings during the withdrawal calculation, the attacker received significantly more tokens back than they had deposited.\n6.  They repaid the flash loan and kept the profit.\n\n**5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?**\nThe root cause was a flaw in the **strategy's logic for calculating the value of the underlying LP tokens**. The contract did not correctly account for the slippage or price impact that occurs when the underlying pool (Ellipsis) is heavily imbalanced. It relied on a calculation that assumed a relatively balanced pool, allowing the attacker to artificially inflate the share price via a flash loan and exit with unearned profit.",
