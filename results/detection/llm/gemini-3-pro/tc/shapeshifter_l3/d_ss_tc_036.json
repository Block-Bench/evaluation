It blindly trusts the `data` parameter to determine which token to transfer (`_0x771f54`) and the recipient address (`_0x1045d1`). Furthermore, the amount to transfer is derived directly from the user-supplied arguments (`_0x7d6277` or `_0x477183`). This allows any arbitrary caller to instruct the contract to transfer all of its WETH or ERC20 holdings to an address of their choosing.",

The contract decodes the data, sets `_0x347a3f` to 100 ether, identifies the token as WETH, calls `withdraw` to unwrap it, and transfers 100 ETH to the attacker via `payable(_0x1045d1).transfer(...)`.\n5.
