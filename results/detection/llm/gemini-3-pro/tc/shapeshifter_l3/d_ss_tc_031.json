This formula implicitly assumes a 1:1 value ratio and identical decimal precision between the two tokens. In reality, tokens almost always have different prices and decimal places (e.g., WBTC with 8 decimals vs DAI with 18 decimals). An attacker can exploit this by depositing a token with a high raw count (high decimals or low unit value) to dilute the share pool and steal tokens with a low raw count (low decimals or high unit value).\",\n      \"attack_scenario\": \"1. Assume Token A has 18 decimals (e.g., DAI) and Token B has 6 decimals (e.g., USDC). Both are worth $1.\\n2. The pool holds 1,000 units of Token B ($1,000). Raw balance = 1,000 * 10^6 = 10^9.\\n3. Attacker deposits 10^9 raw units of Token A. This is only 10^-9 DAI (essentially $0 value).\\n4. The formula calculates shares: `shares = (TotalSupply * 10^9) / 10^9`. The attacker receives shares equal to 100% of the existing supply, effectively owning 50% of the pool.\\n5. Attacker withdraws their 50% share, receiving 500 USDC ($500) and their tiny DAI amount.\\n6.
