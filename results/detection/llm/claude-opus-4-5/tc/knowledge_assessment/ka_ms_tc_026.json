  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Belt Finance Strategy Exploit\" on binance_smart_chain?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "**Belt Finance Strategy Exploit**\n\nYes, I'm familiar with this security incident.\n\n**1. When did this incident occur?**\nMay 2021\n\n**2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?**\nApproximately $6.2 million\n\n**3. What type of vulnerability was exploited?**\nFlash loan attack combined with oracle/price manipulation\n\n**4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?**\nThe attacker used flash loans to manipulate the pricing mechanism within Belt Finance's strategy vaults on BSC. The attack specifically targeted the beltBUSD vault and its integration with Ellipsis Finance. By executing large flash loan-funded trades, the attacker was able to manipulate the virtual price calculations of the underlying assets, allowing them to deposit at a manipulated lower price and withdraw at a higher price, extracting value from the protocol. The attack was executed multiple times in succession.\n\n**5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?**\nThe root cause was the reliance on manipulable price calculations for the underlying strategy assets. The protocol's pricing mechanism for deposits and withdrawals could be temporarily skewed through large trades within the same transaction, and there were insufficient safeguards against flash loan-based price manipulation. The strategy did not adequately account for the possibility of atomic price manipulation within a single transaction block.\n\nThis was one of several similar flash loan attacks targeting yield aggregators and strategy vaults on BSC during that period.",
