  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Blueberry Protocol Oracle Manipulation\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "Based on my knowledge, I am familiar with a security incident involving Blueberry Protocol related to oracle manipulation.\n\n## Blueberry Protocol Oracle Manipulation Incident\n\n**1. When did this incident occur?**\nFebruary 2024\n\n**2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?**\nApproximately $1.35 million was initially drained, though I believe a significant portion was recovered due to the attacker being a whitehat or the funds being front-run by an MEV bot that returned them.\n\n**3. What type of vulnerability was exploited?**\nOracle manipulation / price oracle misconfiguration\n\n**4. How did the attack work?**\nThe attack exploited a misconfigured oracle in Blueberry's lending protocol. The oracle was returning incorrect price data, which allowed the attacker to manipulate the perceived value of collateral or borrowed assets, enabling them to extract more value than they should have been able to.\n\n**5. What was the root cause?**\nThe root cause was a configuration error in the price oracle implementation. Specifically, there was an issue with how the oracle was set up or how price feeds were being interpreted, leading to incorrect valuations being used in the protocol's lending calculations.\n\n---\n\n**Caveat:** I have moderate confidence in these details, but some specifics (particularly the exact recovery amount and precise technical details of the oracle misconfiguration) may not be fully accurate. I recommend verifying against official post-mortem reports from Blueberry Protocol for complete accuracy.",
