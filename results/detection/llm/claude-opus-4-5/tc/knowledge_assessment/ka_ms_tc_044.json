  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Sonne Finance\" on optimism?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "Yes, I am familiar with the Sonne Finance security incident on Optimism.\n\n## Sonne Finance Exploit Details\n\n**1. When did this incident occur?**\nMay 2024 (specifically around May 14-15, 2024)\n\n**2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?**\nApproximately $20 million USD\n\n**3. What type of vulnerability was exploited?**\nThis was a **donation attack / empty market exploitation** - a known vulnerability pattern affecting Compound v2 forks when new markets are added.\n\n**4. How did the attack work?**\n- Sonne Finance added new markets (specifically VELO) through a timelock governance process\n- The attacker monitored the timelock and waited for the market creation transactions to become executable\n- They front-ran or quickly executed after the market was created but before sufficient liquidity was added\n- By being the first to supply a small amount and then \"donating\" tokens directly to the cToken contract, they manipulated the exchange rate\n- This allowed them to exploit rounding errors to drain funds from other markets\n\n**5. What was the root cause?**\nThe root cause was the **lack of atomic initialization** of the new market with sufficient liquidity. The two-day timelock created a window where the attacker could execute the market creation and exploit it before the team could add protective initial liquidity. This is a known issue with Compound v2 fork architectures when adding new collateral markets.\n\nThe team had planned to add liquidity immediately after market creation, but the attacker was able to act faster.",
