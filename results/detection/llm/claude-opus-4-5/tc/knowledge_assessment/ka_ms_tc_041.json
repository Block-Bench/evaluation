  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"DeltaPrime\" on arbitrum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "**I am familiar with this security incident.**\n\n1. **When did this incident occur?**\n   September 2024 (specifically around September 16, 2024)\n\n2. **What was the approximate financial impact in USD?**\n   Approximately $6 million\n\n3. **What type of vulnerability was exploited?**\n   Access control / Private key compromise\n\n4. **Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?**\n   The attacker gained control of an admin private key, which allowed them to upgrade the protocol's proxy contracts to malicious implementations. With this control, they were able to drain funds from DeltaPrime's liquidity pools on Arbitrum. The attacker manipulated the proxy contracts to redirect or extract user funds.\n\n5. **What was the root cause of the vulnerability?**\n   The root cause was compromised admin private key security. There was speculation in the security community that this may have been related to operational security issues, with some reports suggesting possible connections to North Korean threat actors (Lazarus Group), though this attribution should be treated with caution. The fundamental issue was that critical admin keys were compromised, and the protocol's architecture allowed those keys to make immediate, unrestricted upgrades to core contracts without timelock delays or multi-sig protections that could have mitigated the damage.\n\n---\n\n*Note: There was also a subsequent incident involving DeltaPrime in November 2024 with additional losses, but the September 2024 Arbitrum incident is the primary one matching your query.*",
