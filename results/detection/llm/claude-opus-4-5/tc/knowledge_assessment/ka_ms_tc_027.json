When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "Yes, I am familiar with the Spartan Protocol security incident on Binance Smart Chain.\n\n## Spartan Protocol Liquidity Miscalculation Incident\n\n**1. When did this incident occur?**\nMay 2021 (approximately May 2nd, 2021)\n\n**2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?**\nApproximately $30 million USD\n\n**3. What type of vulnerability was exploited?**\nFlash loan attack combined with a liquidity share calculation flaw\n\n**4. How did the attack work?**\nThe attacker used flash loans to borrow a large amount of BNB, then manipulated the liquidity pool by making large swaps that inflated the pool's asset balance. When burning LP tokens to withdraw liquidity, the flawed calculation allowed the attacker to withdraw more assets than they were entitled to. The attacker repeated this process across multiple pools to drain funds.\n\n**5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?**\nThe root cause was a flawed calculation in how the protocol determined the value of liquidity pool shares during the burn/withdrawal process. Specifically, the protocol calculated the redemption value of LP tokens based on the pool's asset balance *after* a swap had artificially inflated it, rather than properly accounting for the actual proportional share. This allowed attackers to receive disproportionately more assets when removing liquidity compared to what they had deposited.\n\nThe vulnerability essentially stemmed from improper handling of the relationship between pool token supply and underlying asset reserves during liquidity removal operations.",
