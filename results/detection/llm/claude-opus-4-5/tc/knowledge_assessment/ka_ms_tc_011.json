  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"PancakeHunny (PancakeBunny)\" on bsc?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "I'm familiar with the PancakeBunny incident on BSC. Let me share what I know:\n\n## PancakeBunny Exploit\n\n**1. When did this occur?**\nMay 2021 (approximately May 19-20, 2021)\n\n**2. Approximate financial impact:**\nAround $45 million USD\n\n**3. Type of vulnerability:**\nFlash loan attack combined with price/oracle manipulation\n\n**4. How the attack worked:**\n- The attacker took out a large flash loan (primarily in BNB)\n- They used the borrowed funds to manipulate the price of BUNNY/BNB in the liquidity pool\n- PancakeBunny's reward calculation mechanism relied on the manipulated price data\n- The attacker was able to mint a massive amount of BUNNY tokens at the artificially favorable rate\n- They then dumped the BUNNY tokens and repaid the flash loan, keeping the profit\n\n**5. Root cause:**\nThe protocol's minting mechanism for BUNNY rewards used a flawed price calculation that could be manipulated through large trades. It relied on spot prices from the AMM rather than using time-weighted average prices (TWAP) or other manipulation-resistant oracle solutions. This allowed the flash loan to temporarily distort the price used in reward calculations.\n\nThe BUNNY token price crashed significantly (over 90%) following the exploit due to the massive token dump.",
