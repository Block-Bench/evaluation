  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Parity Wallet\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "Yes, I'm familiar with the Parity Wallet incidents. There were actually **two major incidents** involving Parity Wallet on Ethereum:\n\n---\n\n## Incident 1: Parity Multisig Hack\n\n**1. When did this incident occur?**\nJuly 2017\n\n**2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?**\nApproximately $30 million (150,000 ETH at the time)\n\n**3. What type of vulnerability was exploited?**\nAccess control vulnerability\n\n**4. How did the attack work?**\nThe attacker exploited a flaw in the Parity multisig wallet contract where the `initWallet` function was public and could be called by anyone. The attacker called this function to take ownership of wallets, then drained the funds.\n\n**5. Root cause:**\nThe initialization function lacked proper access controls, allowing anyone to reinitialize the wallet and become the owner.\n\n---\n\n## Incident 2: Parity Wallet Freeze\n\n**1. When did this incident occur?**\nNovember 2017\n\n**2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?**\nApproximately $150 million (513,000 ETH) was **frozen** (not stolen)\n\n**3. What type of vulnerability was exploited?**\nAccess control / improper library design\n\n**4. How did the attack work?**\nA user (\"devops199\") accidentally triggered the `initWallet` function on the library contract itself, became its owner, then called `kill()` which self-destructed the library. This rendered all dependent multisig wallets permanently unusable.\n\n**5. Root cause:**\nThe library contract was deployed as a regular contract that could be initialized and destroyed, rather than being properly protected. Wallets delegated calls to this library, so its destruction froze all funds.",
