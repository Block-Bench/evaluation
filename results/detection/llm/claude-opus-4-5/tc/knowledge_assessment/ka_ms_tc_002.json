  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Beanstalk\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "Yes, I'm familiar with the Beanstalk Farms security incident.\n\n## Beanstalk Exploit Details\n\n**1. When did this incident occur?**\nApril 2022 (specifically April 17, 2022)\n\n**2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?**\nApproximately $182 million was stolen from the protocol.\n\n**3. What type of vulnerability was exploited?**\nFlash loan attack combined with governance manipulation\n\n**4. How did the attack work?**\nThe attacker executed a sophisticated multi-step attack:\n- Took out massive flash loans from Aave (around $1 billion in various assets)\n- Used the borrowed funds to acquire a large amount of STALK tokens (Beanstalk's governance token)\n- With the accumulated voting power, the attacker passed a malicious governance proposal (BIP-18) that drained protocol funds\n- The proposal was designed to transfer assets to the attacker's wallet\n- Repaid the flash loans and kept the profit\n\n**5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?**\nThe root cause was a flawed governance mechanism that allowed:\n- Immediate execution of proposals once a voting threshold was met (no time delay/timelock)\n- Flash-loaned tokens to be used for governance voting\n- No snapshot mechanism to prevent same-block voting with borrowed tokens\n\nThe lack of a timelock on governance execution was the critical flaw that enabled the attack to succeed within a single transaction.",
