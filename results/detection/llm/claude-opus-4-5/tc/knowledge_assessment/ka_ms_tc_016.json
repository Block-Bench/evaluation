  "response": "**I am familiar with this security incident.**\n\n1. **When did this incident occur?**\n   January 2022 (specifically January 27, 2022)\n\n2. **What was the approximate financial impact in USD?**\n   Approximately $80 million\n\n3. **What type of vulnerability was exploited?**\n   Input validation failure / Logic error in the bridge contract\n\n4. **Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?**\n   The Qubit Bridge (QBridge) allowed users to deposit ETH on Ethereum and receive wrapped assets on BSC. The attacker exploited a flaw in the deposit function where they could call the deposit function with ETH as the deposit token but without actually sending any ETH. The contract's `deposit` function and a separate `depositETH` function had inconsistent validation logic. The attacker called the deposit function specifying the zero address (representing ETH) as the token, which bypassed proper validation checks. This allowed them to generate deposit events without actually depositing funds, which they then used to mint qXETH on BSC.\n\n5. **What was the root cause of the vulnerability?**\n   The root cause was inadequate input validation in the bridge's deposit logic. Specifically, the contract failed to properly verify that actual ETH was transferred when the zero address was specified as the deposit token. The `deposit` function allowed the zero address as a valid token parameter but didn't enforce that `msg.value` contained the corresponding ETH amount, unlike the dedicated `depositETH` function which had proper checks.",
