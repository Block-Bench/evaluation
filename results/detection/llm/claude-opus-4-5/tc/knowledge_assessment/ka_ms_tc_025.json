  "response": "I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\n\nWhile I'm aware of various security incidents involving SafeMoon (the token itself had notable vulnerabilities exploited in 2023) and I know of BVaults as a yield aggregator platform on BSC, I don't have reliable information about a specific incident called \"BVaults SafeMoon Drain\" in my knowledge base.\n\nIf you're researching this incident, I'd recommend checking:\n- Rekt.news\n- SlowMist's hack database\n- PeckShield or CertiK security alerts\n- The official post-mortem if one was published\n\nI'd rather acknowledge the gap in my knowledge than risk providing inaccurate details about the attack vector, timeline, or financial impact.",
