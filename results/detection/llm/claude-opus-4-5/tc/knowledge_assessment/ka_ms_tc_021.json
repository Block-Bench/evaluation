  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Inverse Finance Oracle Manipulation\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "Yes, I am familiar with the Inverse Finance oracle manipulation incidents. There were actually two significant attacks on Inverse Finance in 2022.\n\n## Incident Details\n\n**1. When did this incident occur?**\n- First attack: April 2022\n- Second attack: June 2022\n\n**2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?**\n- April 2022 attack: Approximately $15.6 million\n- June 2022 attack: Approximately $1.2 million\n- Combined total: ~$16.8 million\n\n**3. What type of vulnerability was exploited?**\nOracle manipulation via flash loans\n\n**4. How did the attack work?**\nThe attacker exploited Inverse Finance's reliance on a price oracle that used the spot price from a liquidity pool (specifically, the INV/ETH SushiSwap pool). The attack flow was:\n- Take out a large flash loan\n- Use the borrowed funds to manipulate the price of INV tokens in the liquidity pool\n- The manipulated price caused the oracle to report an inflated INV price\n- Borrow against the artificially inflated collateral value on Inverse Finance's lending protocol (Anchor)\n- Repay the flash loan and keep the excess borrowed funds\n\n**5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?**\nThe root cause was using a spot-price-based oracle that could be manipulated within a single transaction. The protocol relied on real-time pool prices without sufficient time-weighted averaging (TWAP) or other manipulation-resistant oracle mechanisms, making it vulnerable to flash loan-based price manipulation.",
