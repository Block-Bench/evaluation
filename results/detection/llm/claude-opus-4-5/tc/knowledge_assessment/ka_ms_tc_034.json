  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"UwU Lend Oracle Manipulation\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "Based on my knowledge, I am familiar with this security incident.\n\n## UwU Lend Oracle Manipulation Attack\n\n**1. When did this incident occur?**\nJune 2024\n\n**2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?**\nApproximately $19-20 million in the initial attack, with a follow-up attack occurring shortly after for an additional ~$3.7 million (total around $23 million)\n\n**3. What type of vulnerability was exploited?**\nOracle manipulation combined with flash loans\n\n**4. How did the attack work?**\nThe attacker used flash loans to manipulate the price oracle that UwU Lend relied on for asset pricing. By manipulating the perceived price of certain assets (particularly involving CRV and sUSDe), the attacker was able to:\n- Artificially inflate collateral values\n- Borrow against the manipulated collateral at favorable rates\n- Extract funds from the protocol before prices normalized\n\n**5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?**\nThe root cause was the protocol's reliance on a price oracle that could be manipulated through large but temporary liquidity movements. The oracle did not have sufficient safeguards against flash loan-based price manipulation, such as time-weighted average prices (TWAP) with adequate windows or circuit breakers for extreme price movements.\n\n**Note:** UwU Lend was a fork of Aave, and the vulnerability was related to custom oracle implementations rather than inherited from the original Aave codebase.",
