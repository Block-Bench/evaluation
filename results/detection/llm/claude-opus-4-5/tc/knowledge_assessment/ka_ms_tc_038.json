  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Shezmu Protocol\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "I am familiar with this security incident involving Shezmu Protocol.\n\n1. **When did this incident occur?**\n   September 2024\n\n2. **What was the approximate financial impact in USD?**\n   Approximately $4.9 million was initially at risk, though a significant portion was recovered through negotiation with the attacker.\n\n3. **What type of vulnerability was exploited?**\n   Access control / Collateral validation vulnerability\n\n4. **Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?**\n   The attacker exploited a flaw in Shezmu's vault system that allowed them to use an unauthorized collateral token (ShezmuUSD) to mint and borrow assets. The vault failed to properly validate which tokens could be used as collateral, allowing the attacker to deposit ShezmuUSD and borrow against it when this should not have been permitted.\n\n5. **What was the root cause of the vulnerability?**\n   The root cause was insufficient validation in the vault's collateral acceptance logic. The smart contract did not properly restrict which tokens could be deposited as collateral, allowing an unintended token type to be used for minting/borrowing operations.\n\n**Additional note:** This incident is notable because Shezmu negotiated with the attacker, offering a 10% white hat bounty, and the attacker returned a substantial portion of the funds.",
