  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Alpha Homora Credit Account Manipulation\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "Yes, I am familiar with this security incident.\n\n## Alpha Homora Credit Account Manipulation\n\n**1. When did this incident occur?**\nFebruary 2021 (approximately February 13, 2021)\n\n**2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?**\nApproximately $37 million\n\n**3. What type of vulnerability was exploited?**\nThis was a complex attack involving flash loans and a rounding error/accounting manipulation vulnerability in the integration between Alpha Homora and Iron Bank (Cream Finance).\n\n**4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?**\nThe attacker exploited a vulnerability in how Alpha Homora V2 interacted with Iron Bank's lending protocol. The attack involved:\n- Using flash loans to manipulate the state of Alpha Homora's \"HomoraBank\" contract\n- Exploiting a flaw that allowed the attacker to artificially inflate their borrowing credit/debt position\n- The attacker was able to borrow significantly more funds from Iron Bank than their collateral should have permitted\n- This was achieved through repeated interactions that manipulated the internal accounting of credit positions\n\n**5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?**\nThe root cause was a flaw in the credit system between Alpha Homora V2 and Iron Bank, specifically in how borrowing limits and debt positions were calculated and validated. There was insufficient validation of the relationship between collateral and borrowed amounts, combined with a rounding error that could be exploited through repeated transactions to inflate borrowing capacity beyond legitimate limits.",
