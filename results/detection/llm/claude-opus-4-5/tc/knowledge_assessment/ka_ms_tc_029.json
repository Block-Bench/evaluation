  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Radiant Capital Rounding Exploit\" on arbitrum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "I am familiar with this security incident.\n\n1. **When did this incident occur?** January 2024\n\n2. **What was the approximate financial impact in USD?** Approximately $4.5 million\n\n3. **What type of vulnerability was exploited?** Rounding error / precision loss vulnerability in the lending protocol's math\n\n4. **Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?** The attacker exploited a rounding error in Radiant Capital's lending market on Arbitrum. By manipulating the timing and size of deposits/withdrawals in a new market with low liquidity, the attacker was able to exploit precision loss in the index calculations. This allowed them to withdraw more assets than they should have been entitled to, essentially draining value through repeated operations that accumulated rounding errors in their favor.\n\n5. **What was the root cause of the vulnerability?** The root cause was insufficient protection against rounding manipulation in newly created or low-liquidity markets. The protocol's share/index calculation mechanism didn't adequately handle edge cases where an attacker could be the first or dominant depositor and manipulate the exchange rate between shares and underlying assets. This is similar to the classic \"first depositor\" or \"inflation attack\" vulnerability seen in other lending/vault protocols.\n\nThis incident is distinct from the much larger Radiant Capital hack that occurred later in October 2024, which involved compromised private keys and resulted in approximately $50 million in losses.",
