  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Rari Capital Fuse\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "Yes, I am familiar with this security incident.\n\n**1. When did this incident occur?**\nApril 2022 (specifically around April 30, 2022)\n\n**2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?**\nApproximately $80 million USD\n\n**3. What type of vulnerability was exploited?**\nReentrancy vulnerability\n\n**4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?**\nThe attacker exploited a reentrancy vulnerability in Rari Capital's Fuse lending pools. The attack targeted the borrowing function, where the attacker could re-enter the contract during execution before balances were updated. This allowed them to borrow funds repeatedly against the same collateral, draining multiple Fuse pools. The attack was similar to the classic reentrancy pattern but applied to the lending/borrowing logic.\n\n**5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?**\nThe root cause was the lack of proper reentrancy guards on functions that handled external calls before updating internal state (violating the checks-effects-interactions pattern). The vulnerable code was actually inherited from a fork of Compound's codebase that Fuse was built upon, but modifications or the specific implementation context introduced the vulnerability. The contract failed to properly protect against callback exploitation during the borrow/withdrawal process.\n\nNote: This incident was part of a broader attack that also affected other protocols using similar code, and it's sometimes discussed alongside the Fei Protocol merger context since Rari had merged with Fei Protocol prior to the hack.",
