  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Warp Finance LP Token Price Manipulation\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "**Yes, I am familiar with the Warp Finance LP Token Price Manipulation incident.**\n\n1. **When did this incident occur?**\n   December 2020 (approximately December 17-18, 2020)\n\n2. **What was the approximate financial impact in USD?**\n   Approximately $7.7-7.8 million was stolen, though a portion (around $5.85 million) was later recovered.\n\n3. **What type of vulnerability was exploited?**\n   Flash loan attack combined with oracle manipulation (specifically LP token price manipulation)\n\n4. **Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?**\n   - The attacker took out a large flash loan from dYdX and Uniswap\n   - They used the borrowed funds to manipulate the price of Uniswap LP tokens that Warp Finance used as collateral\n   - By artificially inflating the value of the LP tokens through large swaps, the attacker made their collateral appear more valuable than it actually was\n   - This allowed them to borrow more stablecoins (DAI and USDC) from Warp Finance than their collateral should have permitted\n   - The attacker then repaid the flash loans and kept the excess borrowed funds\n\n5. **What was the root cause of the vulnerability?**\n   Warp Finance relied on a flawed price oracle mechanism for valuing LP tokens. The protocol calculated LP token prices based on the spot reserves in Uniswap pools, which could be temporarily manipulated within a single transaction via flash loans. The oracle did not use time-weighted average prices (TWAP) or other manipulation-resistant pricing mechanisms for the LP token collateral.",
