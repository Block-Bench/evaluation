  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"BurgerSwap Fake Token\" on binance_smart_chain?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "**I am familiar with this security incident.**\n\n1. **When did this incident occur?**\n   May 2021\n\n2. **What was the approximate financial impact in USD?**\n   Approximately $7.2 million\n\n3. **What type of vulnerability was exploited?**\n   Flash loan attack combined with a fake token exploit (lack of proper token validation)\n\n4. **Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?**\n   The attacker created a fake token and used it to manipulate BurgerSwap's AMM. They:\n   - Took out a flash loan of WBNB\n   - Created a trading pair between the fake token and legitimate tokens\n   - Exploited the lack of reentrancy protection and token validation in BurgerSwap's swap function\n   - Manipulated the reserves/pricing through the fake token pair\n   - Drained legitimate tokens (BURGER, WBNB, and others) from liquidity pools\n   - Repaid the flash loan and kept the profit\n\n5. **What was the root cause of the vulnerability?**\n   BurgerSwap lacked proper validation to ensure that tokens being swapped were legitimate/whitelisted tokens in the protocol. Unlike Uniswap V2 (which BurgerSwap was forked from), it didn't have adequate reentrancy guards, and the swap function could be called with arbitrary token contracts. This allowed the attacker to use a malicious fake token contract to manipulate the swap logic and drain funds.",
