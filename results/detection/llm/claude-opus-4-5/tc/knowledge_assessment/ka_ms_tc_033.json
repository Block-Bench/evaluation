  "response": "Based on my knowledge, I am familiar with a security incident involving Prisma Finance related to delegate approval functionality.\n\n## Prisma Finance Delegate Approval Incident\n\n**1. When did this incident occur?**\nMarch 2024\n\n**2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?**\nApproximately $11-12 million USD\n\n**3. What type of vulnerability was exploited?**\nAccess control / Input validation vulnerability related to the delegate approval mechanism\n\n**4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?**\nThe attacker exploited a flaw in Prisma Finance's MigrateTroveZap contract. The vulnerability allowed an attacker to use the delegate approval system to manipulate operations on behalf of other users. Specifically, the contract failed to properly validate that the caller was authorized to perform migrations, allowing the attacker to drain collateral from user positions that had granted approvals to the vulnerable contract.\n\n**5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?**\nThe root cause was insufficient access control validation in the migration contract. The contract allowed arbitrary callers to execute operations using delegated permissions that users had granted, without properly verifying the caller's authorization. Users who had approved the MigrateTroveZap contract were vulnerable because the contract didn't restrict who could invoke its functions on their behalf.\n\n---\n\n*Note: I have moderate confidence in these details, but some specifics may vary slightly from official post-mortem reports. I recommend verifying against primary sources for complete accuracy.*",
