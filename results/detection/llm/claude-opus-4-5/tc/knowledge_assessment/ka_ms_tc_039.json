  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Hedgey Finance\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "Yes, I am familiar with the Hedgey Finance security incident.\n\n1. **When did this incident occur?**\n   April 2024\n\n2. **What was the approximate financial impact in USD?**\n   Approximately $44-47 million total across multiple chains (Ethereum and Arbitrum were both affected). The Ethereum portion was approximately $1.9 million, with the larger loss occurring on Arbitrum.\n\n3. **What type of vulnerability was exploited?**\n   Input validation vulnerability / lack of proper parameter validation\n\n4. **Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?**\n   The attacker exploited a flaw in Hedgey's ClaimCampaigns contract. The vulnerability allowed the attacker to create malicious claim campaigns with crafted parameters, then exploit the contract's logic to drain tokens. The attacker was able to manipulate the claim functionality by providing malicious input that wasn't properly validated, allowing them to claim tokens they weren't entitled to.\n\n5. **What was the root cause of the vulnerability?**\n   The root cause was insufficient input validation in the contract's claim creation and execution functions. The contract failed to properly verify that user-supplied parameters were legitimate, allowing an attacker to pass malicious data that manipulated the contract's behavior. Specifically, there was a lack of validation on user-controlled inputs that were used in token transfer operations.\n\nThe attack happened shortly after the contracts were deployed, and the attacker used flash loans as part of the exploit execution.",
