  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Gamma Strategies Hypervisor\" on arbitrum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "**I am familiar with this security incident.**\n\n1. **When did this incident occur?**\n   January 2024 (specifically around January 4, 2024)\n\n2. **What was the approximate financial impact in USD?**\n   Approximately $3.4 million (some sources report figures between $3.4-6.2 million across multiple chains, as the exploit affected Gamma on multiple networks)\n\n3. **What type of vulnerability was exploited?**\n   Price manipulation / accounting flaw related to deposit mechanisms\n\n4. **Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?**\n   The attacker exploited a vulnerability in Gamma's Hypervisor vaults by manipulating the price ratio within the liquidity pools. They were able to deposit assets at manipulated prices, receiving more LP tokens than they should have been entitled to. The attacker then withdrew these tokens at the correct price, extracting excess value from the vaults. Flash loans were used to amplify the attack.\n\n5. **What was the root cause of the vulnerability?**\n   The root cause was insufficient price change thresholds on deposits. While Gamma had price manipulation protections in place, the thresholds were set too high (allowing up to 50-200% price changes in some pools), which allowed attackers to manipulate prices within those bounds and still execute profitable exploits. The deposit price checks were not restrictive enough to prevent the manipulation.\n\nGamma responded by pausing deposits and subsequently implementing much tighter price change thresholds.",
