  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"DODO Reinitialization\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "**I am familiar with this security incident.**\n\n1. **When did this incident occur?**\n   March 2021 (specifically around March 8-9, 2021)\n\n2. **What was the approximate financial impact in USD?**\n   Approximately $3.8 million (some sources report figures between $2 million and $3.8 million)\n\n3. **What type of vulnerability was exploited?**\n   Initialization/Access Control vulnerability (specifically, a reinitialization flaw)\n\n4. **Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?**\n   The attacker exploited DODO V2 Crowdpools that had an unprotected `init()` function. The attacker was able to:\n   - Call the `init()` function on already-deployed pool contracts\n   - Reinitialize the pools with their own malicious token as the \"base\" token\n   - Use flash loans to manipulate the pool state\n   - Drain the legitimate assets from the pools by exploiting the reinitialized parameters\n\n5. **What was the root cause of the vulnerability?**\n   The root cause was that the `init()` function on certain DODO V2 Crowdpool contracts lacked proper access controls and could be called multiple times. There was no check to prevent reinitialization after the contract had already been set up, allowing attackers to reset critical pool parameters and substitute malicious tokens for legitimate ones.",
