  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Lendf.Me\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "Yes, I am familiar with the Lendf.Me security incident.\n\n## Lendf.Me Hack Details\n\n**1. When did this incident occur?**\nApril 2020 (specifically around April 19, 2020)\n\n**2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?**\nApproximately $25 million was stolen (though notably, the attacker later returned the funds after being identified)\n\n**3. What type of vulnerability was exploited?**\nReentrancy vulnerability, specifically related to ERC-777 token compatibility\n\n**4. How did the attack work?**\nThe attacker exploited a reentrancy vulnerability in Lendf.Me's integration with imBTC (an ERC-777 token). ERC-777 tokens have callback hooks that execute during transfers. The attacker used these callbacks to re-enter the Lendf.Me contract during a supply/withdraw operation, allowing them to artificially inflate their collateral balance and drain funds from the protocol.\n\n**5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?**\nThe root cause was that Lendf.Me (a fork of Compound) did not properly account for the reentrancy risks posed by ERC-777 tokens and their callback mechanisms. The protocol's functions were not protected against reentrant calls that could occur during token transfers, and the state updates were not performed before external calls (violating the checks-effects-interactions pattern).\n\nThis incident occurred on the same day as a similar attack on Uniswap V1, as both exploited the same ERC-777 reentrancy vector.",
