  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Munchables\" on blast?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "Yes, I am familiar with the Munchables security incident on Blast.\n\n## Munchables Incident Details\n\n**1. When did this incident occur?**\nMarch 2024\n\n**2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?**\nApproximately $62-63 million was initially stolen, though the funds were ultimately recovered.\n\n**3. What type of vulnerability was exploited?**\nAccess control / Insider threat (malicious developer)\n\n**4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?**\nA developer working on the Munchables project (reportedly a North Korean-linked actor who had been hired under a false identity) exploited their privileged access to the protocol's upgradeable proxy contracts. The malicious developer was able to manipulate the contract's storage slots to assign themselves a large ETH balance before the contract was upgraded, then later withdrew those funds.\n\n**5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?**\nThe root cause was a combination of:\n- Insufficient vetting of development team members\n- Excessive trust/access given to a single developer over critical contract infrastructure\n- The use of upgradeable proxy contracts without adequate safeguards or multi-sig controls\n\n**Notable outcome:** The attacker ultimately returned the private keys controlling the stolen funds without demanding ransom, which was an unusual resolution. The Blast team and community pressure may have contributed to this outcome.",
