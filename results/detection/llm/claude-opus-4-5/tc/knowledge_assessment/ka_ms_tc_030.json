  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Socket Gateway Route Manipulation\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "Based on my knowledge, I am familiar with a security incident involving Socket Gateway.\n\n## Socket Gateway Exploit\n\n1. **When did this incident occur?**\n   January 2024\n\n2. **What was the approximate financial impact in USD?**\n   Approximately $3.3 million\n\n3. **What type of vulnerability was exploited?**\n   Access control / Input validation vulnerability\n\n4. **Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?**\n   The attacker exploited a vulnerability in Socket's gateway contract that allowed arbitrary external calls. The attacker was able to manipulate route data to call malicious contracts, specifically targeting users who had previously granted token approvals to the Socket gateway contract. The attacker drained funds from wallets that had given unlimited approvals to the vulnerable contract.\n\n5. **What was the root cause of the vulnerability?**\n   The root cause was insufficient validation of user-supplied route/call data in a newly added route. The contract allowed arbitrary external calls without properly validating the target and calldata, enabling the attacker to craft malicious calls that transferred approved tokens from victim wallets. This was specifically in a route that had been recently added to the protocol.\n\nThe Socket team paused the affected contracts relatively quickly after detection, and some funds were later recovered. This incident highlighted the risks of granting unlimited token approvals to smart contracts.",
