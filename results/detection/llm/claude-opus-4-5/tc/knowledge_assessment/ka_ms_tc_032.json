  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Wise Lending Rounding Error\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "Based on my knowledge, I am familiar with a security incident involving Wise Lending related to a rounding error vulnerability.\n\n## Wise Lending Rounding Error Incident\n\n**1. When did this incident occur?**\nJanuary 2024\n\n**2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?**\nApproximately $460,000\n\n**3. What type of vulnerability was exploited?**\nRounding error / precision loss vulnerability, combined with flash loan usage\n\n**4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?**\nThe attacker exploited a rounding error in the protocol's share calculation mechanism. By using flash loans to manipulate the pool state, the attacker was able to exploit precision loss in the conversion between shares and underlying assets. This allowed them to withdraw more assets than they were entitled to based on their deposited shares.\n\n**5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?**\nThe root cause was improper handling of rounding in the share-to-asset conversion calculations. When dealing with very small or very large numbers, the protocol's math didn't properly account for precision loss, creating an exploitable discrepancy that could be amplified through repeated operations or large flash loan amounts.\n\n---\n\n*Note: I have moderate confidence in these details, but some specifics (particularly the exact financial impact) may vary slightly from different sources. The incident did occur and involved rounding/precision issues in the lending protocol.*",
