  "response": "Yes, I am familiar with the Uranium Finance security incident on Binance Smart Chain.\n\n## Uranium Finance AMM Miscalculation Incident\n\n**1. When did this incident occur?**\nApril 2021 (specifically around April 28, 2021)\n\n**2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?**\nApproximately $50 million USD was stolen.\n\n**3. What type of vulnerability was exploited?**\nSmart contract bug / mathematical miscalculation in the AMM (Automated Market Maker) balance calculation logic.\n\n**4. How did the attack work?**\nThe attacker exploited a critical error in Uranium Finance's modified Uniswap V2 fork code. The contract had a miscalculation in the swap function's balance verification. Specifically, the code used incorrect multiplier values when checking the constant product formula (k = x * y). The attacker was able to drain liquidity pools by exploiting this mathematical inconsistency, extracting far more tokens than they should have been able to receive in swaps.\n\n**5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?**\nThe root cause was a coding error where the developers changed a multiplier value in one part of the balance check but failed to update the corresponding value elsewhere in the code. The contract used `10000` in one calculation but `100` in another where they should have matched. This created an exploitable discrepancy in the constant product invariant check, allowing the attacker to bypass the AMM's core security mechanism.\n\nThis incident highlights the dangers of modifying battle-tested DeFi code without thorough auditing.",
