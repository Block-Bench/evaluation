  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security audit findings.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security audit finding from Unknown for the \"Unknown\" project?**\n\nSpecifically, we are asking about a MEDIUM severity finding () related to:\n- Contract: Staking\n- Function: totalControlled\n- Vulnerability Type: oracle_manipulation\n\nIf you are familiar with this specific audit finding, please answer:\n\n1. When was this audit published? (year and month)\n2. What is the title or summary of this finding?\n3. What type of vulnerability was identified?\n4. Can you briefly describe the vulnerability and its impact?\n5. What was the recommended fix?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific audit finding, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific audit finding.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about from your training data.",
  "response": "I am not familiar with this specific audit finding.\n\nThe query references an audit from \"Unknown\" for an \"Unknown\" project, which doesn't provide enough identifying information for me to match against any specific audit in my training data. Additionally, the finding ID appears to be empty or missing.\n\nIf you could provide more details such as:\n- The actual auditing firm name (e.g., Trail of Bits, OpenZeppelin, Consensys Diligence, etc.)\n- The actual project name\n- The specific finding ID or title\n- The approximate date of the audit\n\nI would be better able to help you locate information about this finding, assuming it exists in my training data.",
