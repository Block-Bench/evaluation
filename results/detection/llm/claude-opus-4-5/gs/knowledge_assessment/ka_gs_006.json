  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security audit findings.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security audit finding from Code4rena for the \"Hybra Finance\" project?**\n\nSpecifically, we are asking about a MEDIUM severity finding (M05) related to:\n- Contract: GaugeCL\n- Function: notifyRewardAmount\n- Vulnerability Type: logic_error\n\nIf you are familiar with this specific audit finding, please answer:\n\n1. When was this audit published? (year and month)\n2. What is the title or summary of this finding?\n3. What type of vulnerability was identified?\n4. Can you briefly describe the vulnerability and its impact?\n5. What was the recommended fix?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific audit finding, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific audit finding.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about from your training data.",
  "response": "I am not familiar with this specific audit finding.\n\nI don't have knowledge of a Code4rena security audit for a project called \"Hybra Finance\" with a medium severity finding (M05) related to a `GaugeCL` contract's `notifyRewardAmount` function.\n\nA few possibilities:\n1. This audit may not exist in my training data\n2. The project name might be slightly different (e.g., \"Hubble,\" \"Hydra,\" or similar)\n3. This audit may have occurred after my knowledge cutoff date\n4. The details provided may not match any audit I have information about\n\nIf you could provide additional context (such as an alternative project name, approximate date, or link to the audit report), I'd be happy to check if I have relevant information. Otherwise, I recommend consulting the Code4rena website directly for accurate audit findings.",
