  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security audit findings.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security audit finding from Code4rena for the \"Sequence\" project?**\n\nSpecifically, we are asking about a HIGH severity finding (H01) related to:\n- Contract: BaseSig\n- Function: recover\n- Vulnerability Type: access_control\n\nIf you are familiar with this specific audit finding, please answer:\n\n1. When was this audit published? (year and month)\n2. What is the title or summary of this finding?\n3. What type of vulnerability was identified?\n4. Can you briefly describe the vulnerability and its impact?\n5. What was the recommended fix?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific audit finding, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific audit finding.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about from your training data.",
  "response": "I am not familiar with this specific audit finding.\n\nI don't have reliable information in my training data about a Code4rena audit for a project called \"Sequence\" with a HIGH severity finding (H01) related to the `BaseSig` contract's `recover` function involving access control vulnerabilities.\n\nWhile I'm familiar with Code4rena as an audit platform and have knowledge of various blockchain security concepts and some audit findings, I cannot confirm the specific details you're asking about. I don't want to fabricate information about audit dates, titles, vulnerability descriptions, or recommended fixes that I'm not confident are accurate.\n\nIf you're researching this finding, I'd recommend checking:\n- Code4rena's official reports archive\n- The Sequence project's GitHub or documentation\n- Code4rena's findings database directly",
