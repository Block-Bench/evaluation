This audit may have occurred after my knowledge cutoff date\n2. The project name might be slightly different than \"Hybra Finance\"\n3. This specific finding may not be in my training data\n\nIf you could provide additional context (such as an alternative project name, approximate date, or a link to the audit report), I may be able to help further.
