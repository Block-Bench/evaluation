  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security audit findings.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security audit finding from Spearbit for the \"Kyber Hook\" project?**\n\nSpecifically, we are asking about a MEDIUM severity finding (M01) related to:\n- Contract: UniswapV4KEMHook\n- Function: beforeSwap\n- Vulnerability Type: signature_replay\n\nIf you are familiar with this specific audit finding, please answer:\n\n1. When was this audit published? (year and month)\n2. What is the title or summary of this finding?\n3. What type of vulnerability was identified?\n4. Can you briefly describe the vulnerability and its impact?\n5. What was the recommended fix?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific audit finding, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific audit finding.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about from your training data.",
  "response": "I am not familiar with this specific audit finding.\n\nI don't have reliable information in my training data about a Spearbit security audit for a \"Kyber Hook\" project, nor do I have details about a finding labeled M01 related to signature replay vulnerabilities in a `UniswapV4KEMHook` contract's `beforeSwap` function.\n\nWhile I have general knowledge about:\n- Spearbit as a security audit firm\n- Uniswap V4 hooks architecture\n- Signature replay vulnerabilities in smart contracts\n\nI cannot confirm the specific details you're asking about without risking fabricating information. If you have access to this audit report, I'd be happy to help analyze or discuss the finding once you share the relevant details.",
