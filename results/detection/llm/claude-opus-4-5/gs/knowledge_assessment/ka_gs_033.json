  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security audit findings.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security audit finding from Code4rena for the \"Sequence\" project?**\n\nSpecifically, we are asking about a MEDIUM severity finding (M04) related to:\n- Contract: Factory\n- Function: deploy\n- Vulnerability Type: dos\n\nIf you are familiar with this specific audit finding, please answer:\n\n1. When was this audit published? (year and month)\n2. What is the title or summary of this finding?\n3. What type of vulnerability was identified?\n4. Can you briefly describe the vulnerability and its impact?\n5. What was the recommended fix?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific audit finding, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific audit finding.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about from your training data.",
  "response": "I am not familiar with this specific audit finding.\n\nI don't have reliable information in my training data about a specific Medium severity finding (M04) from a Code4rena audit of a \"Sequence\" project related to a DOS vulnerability in a Factory contract's deploy function.\n\nWhile I have general knowledge about Code4rena audits and common vulnerability patterns in factory contracts (such as DOS through block gas limits, griefing attacks on deployment, or front-running issues), I cannot confirm the specific details of this particular finding without risking providing inaccurate information.\n\nIf you need details about this specific audit, I'd recommend:\n1. Checking the Code4rena website directly for Sequence audit reports\n2. Searching their GitHub repository for published findings\n3. Looking at the official Sequence documentation for any referenced security audits",
