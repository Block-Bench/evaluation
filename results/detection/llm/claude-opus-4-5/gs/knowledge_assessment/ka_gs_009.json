When was this audit published? (year and month)\n2. What is the title or summary of this finding?\n3. What type of vulnerability was identified?\n4. Can you briefly describe the vulnerability and its impact?\n5. What was the recommended fix?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific audit finding, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific audit finding.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about from your training data.",
  "response": "I am not familiar with this specific audit finding.\n\nI don't have knowledge of a Code4rena audit for a project called \"Hybra Finance\" with the specific finding you described (M08 in VotingEscrow contract's _checkpoint function).\n\nA few possibilities:\n1. This audit may have occurred after my knowledge cutoff date\n2. The project name might be slightly different than \"Hybra Finance\"\n3. This specific finding may not be in my training data\n\nIf you could provide additional context (such as an alternative project name, or confirm the audit platform), I'd be happy to check if I have related information. Otherwise, I'd recommend consulting the Code4rena findings database directly for accurate details.",
