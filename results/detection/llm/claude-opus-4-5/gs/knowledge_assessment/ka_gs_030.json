  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security audit findings.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security audit finding from Code4rena for the \"Sequence\" project?**\n\nSpecifically, we are asking about a MEDIUM severity finding (M01) related to:\n- Contract: SessionSig\n- Function: hashCallWithReplayProtection\n- Vulnerability Type: signature_replay\n\nIf you are familiar with this specific audit finding, please answer:\n\n1. When was this audit published? (year and month)\n2. What is the title or summary of this finding?\n3. What type of vulnerability was identified?\n4. Can you briefly describe the vulnerability and its impact?\n5. What was the recommended fix?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific audit finding, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific audit finding.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about from your training data.",
  "response": "I am not familiar with this specific audit finding.\n\nI don't have reliable information in my training data about a Code4rena audit for a \"Sequence\" project with a medium severity finding (M01) related to `SessionSig.hashCallWithReplayProtection` and signature replay vulnerabilities.\n\nWhile I have general knowledge about:\n- Code4rena as an audit platform\n- Signature replay vulnerabilities in smart contracts\n- Common patterns in session key implementations\n\nI cannot confirm the specific details you're asking about (publication date, exact title, specific vulnerability description, or recommended fix) without risking fabricating information.\n\nIf you need accurate details about this finding, I'd recommend:\n1. Checking the Code4rena reports archive directly\n2. Searching their GitHub repository for Sequence-related audits\n3. Looking at the Sequence project's official security documentation",
