  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security audit findings.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security audit finding from Spearbit for the \"Aragon Lock To Vote\" project?**\n\nSpecifically, we are asking about a MEDIUM severity finding (M01) related to:\n- Contract: LockManagerERC20\n- Function: _doLockTransfer\n- Vulnerability Type: unchecked_return\n\nIf you are familiar with this specific audit finding, please answer:\n\n1. When was this audit published? (year and month)\n2. What is the title or summary of this finding?\n3. What type of vulnerability was identified?\n4. Can you briefly describe the vulnerability and its impact?\n5. What was the recommended fix?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific audit finding, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific audit finding.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about from your training data.",
  "response": "I am not familiar with this specific audit finding.\n\nWhile I have general knowledge about Spearbit as a security audit firm and common vulnerability patterns in blockchain projects (including unchecked return value issues in ERC20 token transfers), I do not have specific information about this particular audit finding (M01) for the \"Aragon Lock To Vote\" project in my training data.\n\nI can tell you that unchecked return value vulnerabilities in ERC20 transfers are a well-known issue - some ERC20 tokens return `false` on failure rather than reverting, and if the return value isn't checked, the contract may incorrectly assume a transfer succeeded. However, I cannot confirm the specific details, publication date, exact title, or recommended fix for this particular Spearbit finding without risking providing inaccurate information.\n\nIf you need details about this specific audit, I'd recommend checking Spearbit's public audit reports directly or the Aragon project's security documentation.",
