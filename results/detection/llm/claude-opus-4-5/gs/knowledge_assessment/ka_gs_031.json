  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security audit findings.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security audit finding from Code4rena for the \"Sequence\" project?**\n\nSpecifically, we are asking about a MEDIUM severity finding (M02) related to:\n- Contract: ERC4337v07\n- Function: validateUserOp\n- Vulnerability Type: dos\n\nIf you are familiar with this specific audit finding, please answer:\n\n1. When was this audit published? (year and month)\n2. What is the title or summary of this finding?\n3. What type of vulnerability was identified?\n4. Can you briefly describe the vulnerability and its impact?\n5. What was the recommended fix?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific audit finding, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific audit finding.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about from your training data.",
  "response": "I am not familiar with this specific audit finding.\n\nI don't have reliable information in my training data about a Code4rena audit for a project called \"Sequence\" with a medium severity finding (M02) related to the ERC4337v07 contract's `validateUserOp` function involving a DOS vulnerability.\n\nWhile I have general knowledge about:\n- ERC-4337 (Account Abstraction) and its `validateUserOp` function requirements\n- Common vulnerability patterns in account abstraction implementations\n- Code4rena's audit format and severity classifications\n\nI cannot confirm the specific details of this particular finding without risking providing inaccurate information. If you need details about this audit, I'd recommend checking Code4rena's public reports directly at their website or GitHub repository.",
