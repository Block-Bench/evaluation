  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security audit findings.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security audit finding from Code4rena for the \"Sequence\" project?**\n\nSpecifically, we are asking about a MEDIUM severity finding (M03) related to:\n- Contract: BaseAuth\n- Function: recoverSapientSignature\n- Vulnerability Type: logic_error\n\nIf you are familiar with this specific audit finding, please answer:\n\n1. When was this audit published? (year and month)\n2. What is the title or summary of this finding?\n3. What type of vulnerability was identified?\n4. Can you briefly describe the vulnerability and its impact?\n5. What was the recommended fix?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific audit finding, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific audit finding.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about from your training data.",
  "response": "I am not familiar with this specific audit finding.\n\nI don't have reliable information in my training data about a Code4rena audit for a \"Sequence\" project with a Medium severity finding (M03) related to a `recoverSapientSignature` function in a `BaseAuth` contract.\n\nWhile I have general knowledge of Code4rena audits and blockchain security concepts, I cannot confirm the specific details you're asking about (publication date, exact title, vulnerability description, or recommended fix) without risking providing inaccurate information.\n\nIf you need details about this specific finding, I'd recommend checking the Code4rena reports directly at their official website or GitHub repository.",
