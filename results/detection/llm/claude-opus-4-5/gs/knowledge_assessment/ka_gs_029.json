  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security audit findings.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security audit finding from Code4rena for the \"Sequence\" project?**\n\nSpecifically, we are asking about a HIGH severity finding (H02) related to:\n- Contract: Calls\n- Function: execute\n- Vulnerability Type: signature_replay\n\nIf you are familiar with this specific audit finding, please answer:\n\n1. When was this audit published? (year and month)\n2. What is the title or summary of this finding?\n3. What type of vulnerability was identified?\n4. Can you briefly describe the vulnerability and its impact?\n5. What was the recommended fix?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific audit finding, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific audit finding.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about from your training data.",
  "response": "I am not familiar with this specific audit finding.\n\nI don't have reliable information in my training data about a Code4rena audit for a project called \"Sequence\" with a HIGH severity finding (H02) related to signature replay in a `Calls.execute` function.\n\nWhile I have general knowledge about:\n- Code4rena as an audit platform\n- Signature replay vulnerabilities in smart contracts (which typically involve missing nonces, chain ID checks, or contract address binding in signed messages)\n- Common patterns in wallet/multisig contracts\n\nI cannot confirm the specific details of this particular audit finding, including its publication date, exact title, or recommended fix. Providing fabricated details about security audits could be harmful, so I prefer to acknowledge the limits of my knowledge here.\n\nIf you need this information, I'd recommend checking Code4rena's public reports directly at code4rena.com/reports.",
