  "response": "I am not familiar with this specific audit finding.\n\nI don't have knowledge of a Code4rena audit for a project called \"Hybra Finance\" with a medium severity finding (M02) related to a `GaugeV2` contract's `emergencyWithdraw` function in my training data.\n\nA few possibilities:\n1. This audit may have occurred after my knowledge cutoff date\n2. The project name might be slightly different than \"Hybra Finance\"\n3. This specific finding may not have been included in my training data\n\nIf you could provide additional context (such as an alternative project name, approximate date, or a link to the audit report), I may be able to help further. Otherwise, I'd recommend checking Code4rena's public audit repository directly for accurate information about this finding.",
