    "description": "Governance can configure `DynamicSwapFeeModule` with fees up to 50%, but `CLFactory.getSwapFee` discards any value above 100_000 ppm (10%) and falls back to the tick-spacing default (often 500 ppm = 0.05%) without reverting or logging. Operators see the module reporting 20%, yet users continue paying the tiny default fee. The silent fallback misleads governance into believing higher fees are active. Impact - Governance believes a protective high fee is set (e.g., during launch anti-MEV), but the effective fee drops back to the default (e.g., 0.05%). - Traders are charged far less than intended, defeating protective or revenue objectives. - The misconfiguration has no on-chain signal, so the mistake can persist unnoticed. Root Cause - getSwapFee checks fee <= 100_000 ; larger values are ignored and the function returns tickSpacingToFee . - The module itself allows feeCap up to 500_000 (50%), so governance can set a value the factory immediately discards in favor of the default.",

Emit events or add admin tooling to surface out-of-range configurations so operators can correct them. Hybra Finance mitigated: Added setMaxFee() function to make the fee cap configurable by the owner (up to 50%). This replaces the hardcoded limit and allows governance to adjust the maximum dynamic fee when needed.",

Key security observations: 1) All administrative functions (setOwner, setSwapFeeManager, etc.) have proper access control requiring the current role holder to make changes. 2) Pool creation uses deterministic cloning with proper validation (token ordering, non-zero addresses, valid tick spacing). 3) Fee modules use excessivelySafeStaticCall with gas limits and return value bounds checking, preventing malicious fee modules from causing issues. 4) The collectAllProtocolFees function iterates over all pools which could be gas-intensive with many pools, but this is a design choice for owner convenience, not a vulnerability since it's owner-restricted. 5) The contract properly prevents duplicate pools and validates tick spacing bounds. 6) While the owner has significant control (can collect fees, enable tick spacings), this is intentional design - the owner being malicious is out of scope per the analysis guidelines. The contract follows security best practices for factory patterns and does not contain exploitable vulnerabilities that could be triggered by non-privileged users."
