    "description": "Governance can configure `DynamicSwapFeeModule` with fees up to 50%, but `CLFactory.getSwapFee` discards any value above 100_000 ppm (10%) and falls back to the tick-spacing default (often 500 ppm = 0.05%) without reverting or logging. Operators see the module reporting 20%, yet users continue paying the tiny default fee. The silent fallback misleads governance into believing higher fees are active. Impact - Governance believes a protective high fee is set (e.g., during launch anti-MEV), but the effective fee drops back to the default (e.g., 0.05%). - Traders are charged far less than intended, defeating protective or revenue objectives. - The misconfiguration has no on-chain signal, so the mistake can persist unnoticed. Root Cause - getSwapFee checks fee <= 100_000 ; larger values are ignored and the function returns tickSpacingToFee . - The module itself allows feeCap up to 500_000 (50%), so governance can set a value the factory immediately discards in favor of the default.",

Emit events or add admin tooling to surface out-of-range configurations so operators can correct them. Hybra Finance mitigated: Added setMaxFee() function to make the fee cap configurable by the owner (up to 50%). This replaces the hardcoded limit and allows governance to adjust the maximum dynamic fee when needed.",

    "overall_explanation": "After thorough analysis of the CLFactory contract, no exploitable vulnerabilities were identified. The contract follows standard factory patterns for creating concentrated liquidity pools. Key security observations:\n\n1. **Access Control**: All privileged functions properly check msg.sender against the appropriate manager roles (owner, swapFeeManager, unstakedFeeManager, protocolFeeManager). Role transfers require the current holder to initiate and prevent setting to address(0).\n\n2. **Fee Module Safety**: The getSwapFee, getUnstakedFee, and getProtocolFee functions use excessivelySafeStaticCall to query external fee modules, which prevents reentrancy and handles failures gracefully by falling back to default values. Fee caps are enforced (100_000 for swap fees, 1_000_000 for unstaked fees, 500_000 for protocol fees).\n\n3. **Pool Creation**: The createPool function has proper validation - checks for same token, zero address, valid tick spacing, and prevents duplicate pools. Uses deterministic cloning for predictable addresses.\n\n4. **Tick Spacing Configuration**: enableTickSpacing properly validates bounds (tickSpacing > 0 && < 16384, fee > 0 && <= 100_000) and prevents overwriting existing configurations.\n\n5. **collectAllProtocolFees DoS Risk**: While iterating over allPools could theoretically hit gas limits with many pools, this is an owner-only function and the owner can use collectProtocolFees for individual pools as a workaround. This is a design consideration rather than a vulnerability.\n\n6. **No Reentrancy Concerns**: State changes occur before external calls where relevant, and the factory doesn't hold user funds directly.\n\nThe contract appears well-designed with appropriate safety measures for a factory contract managing AMM pool deployment and fee configurations."
