The StakingRewards contract only has one function beyond the constructor: recoverERC20(), which is protected by onlyOwner modifier. While the owner can recover any ERC20 tokens (including the rewards token), this is a design choice for emergency recovery, not a vulnerability - it requires trusting the owner, which is an explicit assumption of the contract. The RewardToken is a standard ERC20 with initial minting to the deployer, which is normal behavior. There are no reentrancy risks (SafeERC20 is used), no arithmetic issues (Solidity 0.8+ has built-in overflow protection), and no access control bypasses. The contracts are intentionally simple with no staking logic, deposits, or user funds at risk. The only potential concern is that there's no mechanism to transfer ownership in StakingRewards (unlike RewardToken which inherits Ownable), but this is a design limitation, not a security vulnerability - it doesn't enable any attack. The contract does what it's designed to do safely."
