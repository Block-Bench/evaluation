The use of transfer() can cause withdrawals to revert for depositors that are smart contracts with complex receive/fallback logic (2300 gas stipend), potentially making their own funds hard to withdraw, but this is not an attacker-driven exploit against other users\u2019 funds or contract state and therefore does not meet the criteria for a concrete, third-party exploitable vulnerability."
