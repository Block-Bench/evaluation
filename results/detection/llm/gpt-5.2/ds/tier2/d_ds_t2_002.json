There are no public functions that move funds to arbitrary callers, no staking/deposit/withdraw logic, and no external calls that could be abused by non-privileged users.\n\nRewardToken is a standard OpenZeppelin ERC20 + Ownable token that mints an initial supply to the deployer. No exploitable issues are apparent in the shown code."
