Since `onlyOwner` only checks `owners[msg.sender] != 0`, an attacker can make themselves an owner by calling `newOwner(attackerAddress)` (resulting in `owners[attackerAddress]` being non-zero). This immediately grants the attacker access to privileged functions guarded by `onlyOwner`, including `TestContract.withdrawAll()`, enabling full theft of the contract\u2019s Ether balance.",
