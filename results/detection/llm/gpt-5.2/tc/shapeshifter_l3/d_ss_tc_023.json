There are no state variables, no token transfers, no Ether handling, and no privileged state changes. Because the only external interaction is a best-effort call whose failure is swallowed, and there is no subsequent logic that relies on the permit succeeding (the internal function does nothing), there is no concrete attack that leads to loss of funds, unauthorized access, or state manipulation within this contract."
