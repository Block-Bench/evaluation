Because cancelCampaign only checks `campaigns[campaignId].manager == msg.sender`, an attacker can set `campaign.manager` to the tokenLocker address and have the tokenLocker reenter and cancel (or cancel and recreate) the campaign, resulting in a final on-chain campaign state different from what the original call appeared to create, or even no campaign at all despite successful token-lock side effects.",
