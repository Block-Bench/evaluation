The deposit function accounts for fee-on-transfer tokens by crediting the user based on the observed balance delta (balAfter - balBefore), avoiding over-crediting.\n\nNotes: The contract does not check ERC20 return values for transfer/transferFrom, which can cause compatibility issues or user fund loss only with non-standard/malicious tokens that return false without reverting or behave incorrectly. However, this is not a concrete, permissionless exploit against the vault for a well-behaved ERC20 and does not enable an attacker to steal other users\u2019 funds."
