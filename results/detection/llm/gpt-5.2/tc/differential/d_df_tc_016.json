As a result, CrossChainBridge.deposit() will emit a Deposit event for a deposit that is not actually backed by locked assets. In typical bridge architectures, relayers/watchers act on this event to mint/release assets on the destination chain, so this becomes a direct unbacked mint/inflation vector without requiring any trusted role compromise.",
