There is no way for an unprivileged attacker to withdraw other users\u2019 funds.\n- The separate `balance` variable can become inconsistent with the contract\u2019s actual ETH balance if ETH is forcibly sent via `selfdestruct`, but this does not enable theft or privilege escalation; at worst it can lead to accounting mismatch/locked excess ETH, which is not an exploitable loss-of-funds vector for attackers in this contract.\n\nGiven the scope and the code shown, user funds are not extractable beyond their own deposits."
