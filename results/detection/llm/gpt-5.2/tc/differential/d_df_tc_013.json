There is no apparent way to inflate totalSupply without contributing ETH, or to redeem more ETH than is accounted for.\n- burnToEther() transfers ETH using .transfer (2300 gas), which prevents reentrancy via the receiver.\n- transfer() performs an external call to the recipient contract via _notifyTransfer(), but it is guarded by nonReentrant and does not expose a direct fund-loss path within this contract.\n\nNote: receive() accepts ETH without updating totalAssetSupply, which can cause donated/forced ETH to become unrecoverable by anyone via burnToEther() (economic/accounting mismatch). This is a funds-stuck design footgun for ETH sent directly to the contract, but it is not an attacker-profitable exploit against others under the requested criteria."
