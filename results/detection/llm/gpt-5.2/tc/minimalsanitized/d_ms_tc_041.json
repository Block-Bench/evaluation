While this is a poor practice (silent failure / unclear behavior), it is not exploitable here for profit or unauthorized state manipulation because: (1) the contract performs no sensitive state changes before/after the call, (2) there are no functions in this snippet that manage funds, approvals, deposits, or debts in a way that could be reentered or corrupted, and (3) the call is not a delegatecall, so the callee cannot execute in SmartLoan\u2019s context. SmartLoansFactory.upgradePool() is admin-gated and contains only comments, so it is not exploitable by non-admins. Therefore, based solely on the provided code, there is no concrete attack path leading to loss of funds or unauthorized access."
