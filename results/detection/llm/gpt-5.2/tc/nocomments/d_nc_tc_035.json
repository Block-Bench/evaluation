Other concerning patterns (e.g., ignoring ERC20 return values in `mint()` and `borrow()`, permissionless `TestOracle.setPrice()`, and permissionless `enterMarkets()`) do not lead to an exploitable loss of funds within the current logic because collateral value is never computed/used to enable borrowing. The contract is largely non-functional (e.g., no redeem/withdraw, empty liquidation), but those are design/incompleteness issues rather than exploitable vulnerabilities under the stated criteria."
