Core state changes in unlock/emergencyUnlock delete user state before transferring tokens, preventing reentrancy-based double-withdrawals even if the token were malicious. Access control on admin-only functions is correctly enforced. Users can only unlock their own locks. The main risks observed are either non-exploitable by untrusted parties (e.g., admin can redirect lockRecipient by design) or are design/UX issues rather than security bugs (e.g., locking multiple times overwrites PlayerSettings while playerBalances accumulates, which could confuse accounting but does not allow an attacker to steal funds). The contract assumes the immutable token address behaves like standard WETH; transfer/transferFrom return values are not checked, but with standard WETH this is not exploitable."
