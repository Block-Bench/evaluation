Additionally, the collateral/borrow accounting logic is effectively non-functional because calculateBorrowPower() and calculateTotalBorrows() iterate over a hardcoded, uninitialized local array (LN-94, LN-126), meaning real markets are not enumerated; this mostly results in broken functionality (borrows typically revert due to zero borrowPower) rather than a profitable exploit. While addMarket() is permissionless (LN-147 to LN-150) and would be a serious issue in a production lending protocol, in this specific code it does not enable a concrete theft path because there is no mechanism that moves assets out of the contract."
