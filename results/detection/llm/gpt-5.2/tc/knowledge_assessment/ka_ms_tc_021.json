  "response": "Yes. I\u2019m familiar with the **Inverse Finance oracle manipulation** exploit on Ethereum (often referred to as the Inverse Finance / FiRM oracle manipulation attack involving the INV price oracle).\n\n1. **When did this incident occur?**  \n   **2022, early April** (widely reported around **April 2, 2022**).\n\n2. **Approximate financial impact (USD)?**  \n   Approximately **$15\u201316 million USD** (commonly cited around **$15.6M**).\n\n3. **Type of vulnerability exploited?**  \n   **Oracle manipulation** (enabled by **flash-loan-style liquidity / price manipulation**).\n\n4. **Briefly, how did the attack work?**  \n   The attacker manipulated the on-chain market price of **INV** (the Inverse Finance token) on a DEX pair used (directly or indirectly) as the protocol\u2019s price reference. With the INV price artificially inflated, the attacker was able to **post INV as collateral at an exaggerated valuation** in Inverse Finance\u2019s lending system and then **borrow assets (e.g., DOLA and/or other tokens) against that inflated collateral**. After borrowing, the attacker could unwind/exit while leaving the protocol with under-collateralized debt once the price returned to normal.\n\n5. **Root cause of the vulnerability?**  \n   The protocol relied on a **manipulable on-chain price oracle** for INV (e.g., DEX-based pricing with **insufficient liquidity and/or insufficiently robust averaging/guardrails**), allowing the attacker to move the oracle price significantly within the window used for collateral valuation. A lack of effective safeguards (such as deeper-liquidity oracle sources, longer/safer TWAP windows, price deviation checks, circuit breakers, or tighter collateral parameters for illiquid assets) contributed to feasibility.",
