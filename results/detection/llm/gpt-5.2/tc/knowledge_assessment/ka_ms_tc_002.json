  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Beanstalk\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "Yes \u2014 Beanstalk (the Ethereum-based \u201cBeanstalk Farms\u201d stablecoin protocol) suffered a major exploit.\n\n1. **When did this incident occur?**  \n   **April 2022** (specifically mid\u2011April; widely reported as **April 17, 2022**).\n\n2. **Approximate financial impact (USD)?**  \n   Approximately **$180M** (commonly reported around **$182M**).\n\n3. **What type of vulnerability was exploited?**  \n   A **flash-loan-enabled governance attack** (i.e., **governance / voting manipulation using flash loans**).\n\n4. **Briefly describe how the attack worked**  \n   The attacker used a **flash loan** to temporarily acquire a very large amount of governance/voting power, enough to pass a malicious governance proposal. In the same transaction, they:  \n   - **Borrowed** assets via flash loans  \n   - **Converted/positioned** them to obtain overwhelming voting rights  \n   - **Voted in and executed** a proposal that transferred protocol funds to the attacker-controlled address  \n   - **Repaid** the flash loan, keeping the stolen funds\n\n5. **Root cause of the vulnerability**  \n   Beanstalk\u2019s governance mechanism allowed **borrowed (flash-loaned) capital to count for immediate voting power**, and it allowed **proposal execution without sufficient delay/guardrails** (e.g., no effective time-lock, insufficient protection against same-block/instant governance capture, and/or inadequate voting power snapshot mechanics). This made it possible to \u201crent\u201d governance control for one transaction and drain funds.",
