  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Sonne Finance\" on optimism?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "Yes. I am aware of a **Sonne Finance (Optimism)** exploit that is commonly described as a **Compound-fork \u201cinflation/donation\u201d style attack** (sometimes grouped under **collateral valuation / oracle-style manipulation**).\n\n1. **When did this incident occur?**  \n   **2023, approximately mid\u2011May**.\n\n2. **Approximate financial impact (USD)?**  \n   **On the order of ~$20M USD** (commonly reported around the ~$20M range).\n\n3. **What type of vulnerability was exploited?**  \n   **Collateral inflation / exchange-rate manipulation (\u201cdonation\u201d or \u201cinflation\u201d attack)** leading to **overstated collateral value** (often framed as **oracle/collateral valuation manipulation** rather than classic reentrancy).\n\n4. **Brief description of how the attack worked**  \n   In broad terms, the attacker targeted a market where the **cToken (or equivalent receipt token) supply/liquidity was low**, then:  \n   - **Minted a small amount** of the interest-bearing/receipt token.  \n   - **Donated (transferred) underlying assets directly** to the market contract (or otherwise caused \u201ccash\u201d in the market to increase without proportional cToken supply increase).  \n   - This **artificially inflated the market\u2019s exchange rate** (value per receipt token).  \n   - Using these now **overvalued receipt tokens as collateral**, the attacker was able to **borrow other assets** far in excess of what should have been allowed and drain liquidity.\n\n5. **Root cause of the vulnerability**  \n   The protocol\u2019s collateral/value accounting relied on an **exchange rate derived from on-chain balances** (e.g., cash/totalSupply-style math). When **total supply was very small**, a direct transfer (\u201cdonation\u201d) could **move the exchange rate dramatically**, and the system **did not sufficiently guard against this manipulation** (e.g., via minimum liquidity/initial mint constraints, donation-resistant accounting, or tighter collateral/oracle safeguards).\n\nIf you want, I can also describe common mitigations used by lending protocols to prevent this class of inflation/donation attack.",
