  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Qubit Bridge Zero Address Bypass\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "Yes. This refers to the **Qubit Finance \u201cQBridge\u201d exploit** where a **zero-address (ETH) handling/validation bypass** was used to mint unbacked bridged ETH (commonly described as a \u201czero address bypass\u201d).\n\n1. **When did it occur?**  \n   **2022, late January** (publicly reported around **Jan 27, 2022**).\n\n2. **Approximate financial impact (USD)?**  \n   Approximately **$80 million USD** (widely reported in the ~$80M range).\n\n3. **What type of vulnerability was exploited?**  \n   A **smart contract logic / input validation flaw** (often categorized as **improper validation / access-control-like logic error**, specifically around **zero-address handling**).  \n   Not primarily a reentrancy/flash-loan/oracle issue.\n\n4. **Briefly, how did the attack work?**  \n   The attacker was able to call the bridge\u2019s deposit/mint pathway in a way that **made the contract believe ETH had been deposited/bridged when it had not**, by abusing how the contract handled the **zero address (used to represent native ETH)**. This allowed the attacker to **mint unbacked bridged ETH tokens (e.g., qXETH/xETH)**. They then **used those unbacked tokens as collateral** in Qubit\u2019s lending/borrowing system to **borrow and drain other assets**.\n\n5. **Root cause of the vulnerability?**  \n   **Incorrect/missing validation in the bridge logic for the zero-address (native ETH) case**, allowing a \u201cdeposit\u201d to be credited (and tokens minted) **without actual asset backing** (i.e., the contract did not correctly enforce that real ETH/value was provided/verified for that code path).",
