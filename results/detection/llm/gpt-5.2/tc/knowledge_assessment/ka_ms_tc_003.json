  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Parity Wallet\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "Yes. There were two major Parity (Ethereum) wallet incidents in 2017 that are commonly referenced:\n\n## Incident A \u2014 Parity Multisig Wallet Hack (funds stolen)\n1. **When:** **2017, July** (mid\u2013late July 2017)\n2. **Approx. financial impact:** about **150,000 ETH** stolen, widely reported around **~$30M USD** at the time (order-of-magnitude)\n3. **Vulnerability type:** **Access control / improper initialization** (unprotected initialization function)\n4. **How the attack worked (briefly):**\n   - Parity\u2019s multisig wallets were created from a contract pattern that had an **initialization function** (commonly described as `initWallet`).\n   - That initialization function could be (re)called in a way that let an attacker **set themselves as an owner** of certain wallets that had not been properly initialized/secured.\n   - After becoming an owner, the attacker could authorize transfers and **drain ETH** from affected multisig wallets.\n5. **Root cause:**\n   - A **design flaw in the wallet initialization/ownership setup**, where **critical initialization was not adequately access-restricted** (i.e., ownership could be taken by calling an initialization routine under certain conditions).\n\n## Incident B \u2014 Parity Wallet Freeze (funds locked, not stolen)\n1. **When:** **2017, November**\n2. **Approx. financial impact:** about **500,000+ ETH** rendered inaccessible (often cited around **~$150M USD** at the time, order-of-magnitude)\n3. **Vulnerability type:** **Access control / unsafe shared-library pattern** (plus a dangerous `selfdestruct`/kill capability)\n4. **How it worked (briefly):**\n   - Many Parity multisig wallets depended on a **shared library contract** for their core logic.\n   - A user was able to **become the \u201cowner\u201d of the library** (due to initialization/ownership issues) and then **triggered the library\u2019s kill/selfdestruct**.\n   - With the library code gone, dependent wallets could no longer execute withdrawals, effectively **freezing** funds.\n5. **Root cause:**\n   - Use of a **shared on-chain library as a critical dependency** combined with **insufficiently protected initialization/ownership** and the presence of a **selfdestruct/kill mechanism**.\n\nIf you want, I can provide a tighter, single-incident summary depending on whether you mean the **July theft** or the **November freeze**.",
