  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Uranium Finance AMM Miscalculation\" on binance_smart_chain?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "Yes. I\u2019m familiar with the Uranium Finance incident on Binance Smart Chain commonly described as an **\u201cAMM miscalculation\u201d** exploit.\n\n1. **When did this incident occur?**  \n   **2021 (late April, ~Apr 28, 2021)**\n\n2. **Approximate financial impact (USD)?**  \n   **~$50 million** (widely reported in that range)\n\n3. **Type of vulnerability exploited?**  \n   **AMM logic/math bug** (an **incorrect invariant / balance calculation** in the swap math), i.e., a **smart contract logic error** rather than reentrancy or oracle manipulation.\n\n4. **Brief description of how the attack worked**  \n   Uranium Finance had deployed an updated pair/AMM contract (a Uniswap V2-style fork). A flaw in the swap accounting/invariant check meant an attacker could perform swaps crafted so that the contract\u2019s internal checks passed while allowing the attacker to extract **more tokens than should have been possible** from the pool, effectively **draining liquidity reserves** across affected pairs.\n\n5. **Root cause of the vulnerability**  \n   A **mistake introduced in the modified AMM contract code** (relative to the standard Uniswap V2 pair logic), leading to a **miscalculation in the swap invariant / fee-adjusted balance math**. This broken math undermined the constant-product protection and enabled reserve-draining trades.",
