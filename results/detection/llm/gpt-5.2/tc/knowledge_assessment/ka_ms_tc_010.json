  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Rari Capital Fuse\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "Yes. I\u2019m familiar with the **Rari Capital Fuse** exploit on Ethereum (often referred to as the **Rari/FEI Fuse hack**).\n\n1. **When did this incident occur?**  \n   **2022**, **late April** (April 30, 2022 UTC is commonly cited).\n\n2. **Approximate financial impact (USD)?**  \n   Approximately **$75M\u2013$80M** (widely reported around **~$79M**), drained across multiple Fuse pools.\n\n3. **What type of vulnerability was exploited?**  \n   **Reentrancy** (triggered via token transfer callbacks / non-standard ERC20 behavior), resulting in broken accounting / collateral checks.\n\n4. **Briefly describe how the attack worked**  \n   The attacker used a crafted token behavior (a token with a callback / hook-like behavior) to **re-enter** Fuse/Compound-style market logic during token transfer operations. By re-entering at a sensitive point in the mint/borrow/redeem flow, they could **manipulate the protocol\u2019s internal accounting and/or bypass collateral constraints**, allowing them to **borrow/drain assets** from affected Fuse pools.\n\n5. **Root cause of the vulnerability**  \n   **Missing/insufficient reentrancy protection and unsafe ordering of effects vs. external interactions** in the Fuse (Compound-fork) market implementation\u2014i.e., the protocol made **external token calls** in a way that allowed re-entry before key state was fully and safely finalized, enabling the attacker to break invariants around liquidity/collateral/borrow limits.\n\nIf you want, I can also list which classes of Fuse pools were affected and the general mitigation actions taken afterward (pauses, governance response, etc.), but I\u2019ve kept the above to what I\u2019m confident about.",
