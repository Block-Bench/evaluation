  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"PancakeHunny (PancakeBunny)\" on bsc?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "Yes\u2014I'm familiar with the **PancakeBunny (often confused/misspelled as \u201cPancakeHunny\u201d)** exploit on **BSC**.\n\n1. **When did this incident occur?**  \n   **2021, mid\u2011May** (widely reported around **May 19, 2021**).\n\n2. **Approximate financial impact (USD)?**  \n   Roughly **~$45M** was widely reported as the exploit\u2019s impact (separate from the much larger secondary loss from the BUNNY token\u2019s market price collapse).\n\n3. **Type of vulnerability exploited?**  \n   **Flash-loan\u2013enabled price/oracle manipulation** (using manipulable DEX spot pricing rather than a robust oracle/TWAP).\n\n4. **Brief description of how the attack worked**  \n   The attacker used **large flash loans** to temporarily move prices on PancakeSwap liquidity pools that PancakeBunny relied on for pricing. By manipulating the relevant pool prices in the same transaction window, the attacker caused PancakeBunny\u2019s logic to **mint/issue an excessive amount of BUNNY** (or overvalue rewards) and then **dumped the newly minted tokens** back into the market to realize profit, repaying the flash loan and keeping the remainder.\n\n5. **Root cause of the vulnerability**  \n   The protocol\u2019s reward/minting calculations depended on **manipulable on-chain DEX spot prices** (insufficient oracle design / lack of TWAP or other manipulation resistance and bounds), allowing a flash-loan attacker to distort the price long enough to extract value.\n\nIf you meant a *different* \u201cPancakeHunny\u201d project incident distinct from PancakeBunny, I\u2019m not confident enough to provide details on that without risking guessing.",
