When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "Yes. I\u2019m familiar with the **Belt Finance \u201cStrategy Exploit\u201d on Binance Smart Chain** (widely reported in 2021).\n\n1. **When did this incident occur?**  \n   **2021, late May** (around May 28\u201330, 2021 in most public timelines)\n\n2. **Approximate financial impact (USD):**  \n   **~$6M\u2013$6.3M USD** (commonly cited figure range)\n\n3. **Type of vulnerability exploited:**  \n   **Flash-loan\u2013enabled price/oracle manipulation** (economic attack via manipulated pool pricing/virtual price used by the strategy)\n\n4. **Briefly, how the attack worked:**  \n   The attacker used a **flash loan** to temporarily move a large amount of stablecoins through the relevant stable-swap liquidity pool(s), **distorting the pool\u2019s pricing/\u201cvirtual price\u201d** that Belt\u2019s strategy relied on for accounting (e.g., valuing LP tokens / share minting or redemption). During the manipulated state, they executed deposits/withdrawals (or strategy interactions) at an **artificially favorable rate**, then unwound the manipulation and repaid the flash loan\u2014keeping the difference as profit.\n\n5. **Root cause of the vulnerability:**  \n   The strategy\u2019s accounting/valuation depended on a **manipulable on-chain price metric** (e.g., a pool virtual price/spot-derived value) **without sufficient manipulation resistance** (no robust TWAP, insufficient invariant checks, and/or assumptions that the referenced price could not be moved significantly within a single transaction using flash liquidity).",
