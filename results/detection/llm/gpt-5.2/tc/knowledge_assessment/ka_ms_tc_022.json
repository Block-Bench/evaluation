  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Hundred Finance Reentrancy\" on gnosis?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "Yes. I have some knowledge of the **Hundred Finance reentrancy exploit** that affected its deployments including **Gnosis** (as well as other chains).\n\n1. **When did this incident occur?**  \n   - **2023**, **mid\u2011April** (around **Apr 15\u201316, 2023**).\n\n2. **Approximate financial impact (USD)?**  \n   - I\u2019m confident it was **multi\u2011million USD total** across affected deployments (commonly reported around **~$7M** overall).  \n   - I am **not confident about the exact USD amount attributable specifically to Gnosis** versus other chains.\n\n3. **Type of vulnerability exploited?**  \n   - **Reentrancy**, triggered via interaction with a **non\u2011standard token** behavior (i.e., token transfer that can execute callbacks / reenter).\n\n4. **Brief description of how the attack worked**  \n   - The attacker interacted with a Hundred Finance lending market using a token whose transfer mechanics allowed **callback/reentry during a token transfer**.  \n   - During a core lending action (e.g., borrow/redeem/liquidation-related flows), the attacker was able to **reenter the protocol mid\u2011operation** and manipulate accounting/state transitions in a way that let them **withdraw/borrow more assets than should have been allowed**, draining liquidity from the market(s).\n\n5. **Root cause of the vulnerability**  \n   - The protocol (a Compound-style fork) **assumed ERC\u201120 transfers are non-reentrant** and did not sufficiently protect against **reentrancy during external token calls**.  \n   - Contributing factors typically include **missing/insufficient reentrancy guards** and/or **unsafe ordering of effects vs. interactions** (i.e., making an external token transfer before all relevant internal state is fully updated).\n\nIf you want, I can also tell you what details I\u2019m *not* confident about (e.g., the precise Gnosis-only loss figure or the exact token/market used on Gnosis) so you can cross-check with primary incident reports.",
