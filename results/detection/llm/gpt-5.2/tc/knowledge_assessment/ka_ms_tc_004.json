  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Curve Finance (Vyper Reentrancy)\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "Yes \u2014 I\u2019m familiar with the \u201cCurve Finance (Vyper Reentrancy)\u201d incident on Ethereum.\n\n1. **When did this incident occur?**  \n   **2023, late July** (widely reported around **July 30, 2023**).\n\n2. **Approximate financial impact (USD)?**  \n   **On the order of tens of millions of USD**, with widely reported estimates around **~$70M** total impacted across affected Curve pools (some funds were later recovered/returned in various ways, but the headline impact was in that range).\n\n3. **What type of vulnerability was exploited?**  \n   **Reentrancy**, enabled by a **Vyper compiler bug** that broke/bypassed the intended reentrancy protection.\n\n4. **Briefly, how did the attack work?**  \n   Certain Curve pools had contracts compiled with vulnerable Vyper versions. Attackers were able to **re-enter** pool functions (i.e., call back into them during an external call) in a way that **defeated the intended \u201cnonreentrant\u201d lock**, allowing them to manipulate accounting/order-of-operations and **drain funds** from the pool(s) before the contract state was correctly updated.\n\n5. **Root cause of the vulnerability?**  \n   The root cause was **a bug in specific Vyper compiler versions** that **incorrectly implemented the `@nonreentrant` reentrancy guard** (i.e., generated faulty bytecode for the lock), making contracts that relied on that guard **effectively unprotected** in some cases.",
