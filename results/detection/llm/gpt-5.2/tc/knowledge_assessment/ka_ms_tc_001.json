  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Nomad Bridge\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "Yes. The **Nomad cross-chain bridge** suffered a major exploit in **2022**.\n\n1. **When did this incident occur?**  \n   **August 2022** (widely reported as **Aug 1, 2022**).\n\n2. **Approximate financial impact (USD)?**  \n   Approximately **$190 million USD** was drained (often cited in the ~$150M\u2013$200M range; ~$190M is the common headline figure).\n\n3. **What type of vulnerability was exploited?**  \n   **Improper access control / message validation failure** (i.e., a **cross-chain message verification** bug). Not a reentrancy/flash-loan style exploit.\n\n4. **Briefly describe how the attack worked**  \n   Nomad is a bridge that releases funds on one chain when it sees a *valid proven message* from another chain. Due to a bug/misconfiguration, attackers could submit crafted \u201cmessages\u201d that the contract incorrectly treated as already proven/valid. In practice, many attackers could **copy a successful withdrawal transaction and only change the recipient address and/or amount**, then call the same processing function to withdraw assets to themselves. This turned into a \u201ccopy-paste\u201d draining event with many independent participants.\n\n5. **Root cause of the vulnerability**  \n   A **faulty upgrade / initialization/configuration error** in the bridge\u2019s verification logic caused a critical trusted value (a root/commitment used to validate messages) to be set in a way that made **arbitrary messages appear valid**. In short: the contract\u2019s design relied on correctly-initialized state for message verification, and that invariant was broken, removing the effective authorization check on withdrawals.",
