  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Munchables\" on blast?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "Yes. I\u2019m familiar with the **Munchables (on Blast)** incident.\n\n1) **When did it occur?**  \n- **2024, late March** (the exploit was publicly reported around **March 26\u201327, 2024**).\n\n2) **Approximate financial impact (USD)**  \n- Approximately **$62\u201363 million USD** (widely reported as about **$62.5M**).\n\n3) **Type of vulnerability exploited**  \n- **Access control / privileged-role abuse** (effectively a **backdoor/centralized admin risk**, reportedly tied to an insider/compromised privileged account).\n\n4) **Brief description of how the attack worked**  \n- The attacker used **privileged permissions** in the protocol\u2019s contracts (or a privileged operational role) to enable a mechanism that allowed **user-deposited assets to be transferred out** to an attacker-controlled address.  \n- This was not characterized as a typical \u201cexternal\u201d DeFi bug like reentrancy or oracle manipulation; it was more consistent with **authorized-but-malicious use of special powers** embedded in the system.\n\n5) **Root cause of the vulnerability**  \n- **Overly powerful/admin functionality** and **insufficient trust minimization** (i.e., a privileged role could execute actions that enabled draining funds).  \n- In reporting at the time, it was widely described as an **insider risk** scenario (a developer/contract role with the ability to perform a fund-draining action).\n\nIf you want, I can also summarize the post-incident outcome (e.g., whether funds were recovered), but I\u2019ll leave it here since you asked specifically about the exploit details.",
