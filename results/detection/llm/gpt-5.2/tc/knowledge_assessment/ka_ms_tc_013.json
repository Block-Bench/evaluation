  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"bZx Protocol\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "Yes. bZx had well-known Ethereum incidents in **February 2020** involving **flash loans and price/oracle manipulation** (often discussed as two related attacks a few days apart).\n\n1. **When did this incident occur?**  \n   - **2020, mid-February** (around **Feb 14** and **Feb 18**, 2020).\n\n2. **Approximate financial impact (USD)?**  \n   - Approximately **~$1M total** across the two February attacks is the commonly cited ballpark.  \n   - Individually, they\u2019re often reported roughly around **~$350k** (first) and **~$600k** (second), depending on ETH price and reporting source.\n\n3. **What type of vulnerability was exploited?**  \n   - **Flash loan\u2013enabled price manipulation / oracle manipulation** (using manipulable DEX spot pricing as an input).\n\n4. **Briefly describe how the attack worked**  \n   - The attacker took a **large flash loan** (notably from **dYdX**), then executed trades on AMMs/DEXs (e.g., **Uniswap**, and also routing through other liquidity sources in some writeups) to **push prices** significantly within a single transaction.  \n   - bZx\u2019s trading/borrowing logic relied on these **manipulated on-chain prices** to determine exchange rates / collateral values, letting the attacker open positions or borrow in a way that became profitable due to the artificial price move.  \n   - The attacker then unwound positions and **repaid the flash loan**, keeping the difference as profit.\n\n5. **What was the root cause of the vulnerability?**  \n   - **Oracle design/root cause:** bZx relied on **spot prices from relatively easy-to-manipulate DEX liquidity** (or routes heavily influenced by such spot pricing) without sufficient protections (e.g., **TWAPs**, multiple robust price sources, manipulation resistance, slippage/price-impact bounds, or circuit breakers).  \n   - Flash loans made it possible to access enough temporary capital to move those prices materially **within one block/transaction**.\n\nIf you want, I can separate the two February 2020 attacks more explicitly (they had slightly different trade paths), but the core exploit class in both was the same: **flash-loan-driven manipulation of a price input the protocol trusted.**",
