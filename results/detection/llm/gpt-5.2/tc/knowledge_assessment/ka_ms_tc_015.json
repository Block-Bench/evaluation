  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Indexed Finance Pool Manipulation\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "Yes. \u201cIndexed Finance pool manipulation\u201d usually refers to the May 2021 exploit against Indexed Finance\u2019s Balancer-style index pools (e.g., DEFI5/CC10), where an attacker used large temporary capital to manipulate pool pricing and drain assets.\n\n1. **When did this incident occur?**  \n   **2021 (around May)**\n\n2. **Approximate financial impact (USD)?**  \n   **~$16 million USD** (often reported in the mid\u2013teens of millions)\n\n3. **What type of vulnerability was exploited?**  \n   **Flash-loan-enabled pool/price manipulation** (economic attack against AMM-style pool math/pricing)\n\n4. **Briefly describe how the attack worked**  \n   The attacker obtained large temporary liquidity (via flash loans/flash swaps), then **aggressively traded against an Indexed index pool to push the pool\u2019s internal spot prices/balances to extreme values within a single transaction**. With the pool in that manipulated state, they performed pool operations (mint/redeem/join/exit style actions) that were priced off the manipulated pool state, extracting more value than they put in. They repeated this to drain funds and then repaid the flash liquidity.\n\n5. **Root cause of the vulnerability**  \n   The pool\u2019s mechanics **allowed sensitive value-transfer operations to be executed using manipulable, instantaneous pool state (spot price / balance ratios)** without sufficient safeguards (e.g., resistance to same-transaction manipulation, stronger invariant enforcement under extreme imbalance, or oracle/TWAP-style protections and limits).",
