  "prompt": "You are being assessed on your knowledge of blockchain security incidents.\n\n**Do you have any knowledge of a security exploit or hack involving \"Cream Finance\" on ethereum?**\n\nIf you are familiar with this incident, please answer the following questions:\n\n1. When did this incident occur? (year and approximate month if known)\n2. What was the approximate financial impact in USD?\n3. What type of vulnerability was exploited? (e.g., reentrancy, flash loan, oracle manipulation, access control, etc.)\n4. Can you briefly describe how the attack worked?\n5. What was the root cause of the vulnerability?\n\nIf you are NOT familiar with this specific incident, please respond with:\n\"I am not familiar with this specific security incident.\"\n\nDo not guess or make up information. Only provide details you are confident about.",
  "response": "Yes. I\u2019m familiar with a major C.R.E.A.M. Finance exploit on Ethereum involving a flash-loan-driven price/oracle manipulation attack.\n\n1. **When did this incident occur?**  \n   **2021, early February** (Feb 2021)\n\n2. **Approximate financial impact (USD)?**  \n   Approximately **$35\u201340 million USD** (commonly reported around **$37M**)\n\n3. **Type of vulnerability exploited?**  \n   **Flash loan + oracle/price manipulation** (manipulating the price used to value collateral / compute borrow limits)\n\n4. **Brief description of how the attack worked**  \n   The attacker used **flash loans** to obtain large capital, then **manipulated the on-chain price/exchange rate** of a relevant stablecoin/vault token (widely reported around the **Yearn yUSD / Curve pool pricing path** used by the protocol). By pushing the price to an unfavorable/incorrect level for a short time, the attacker made their collateral appear worth more (or debt appear cheaper) inside C.R.E.A.M.\u2019s lending logic, enabling them to **borrow and drain other assets**. The position was then unwound within the flash-loan transaction, leaving the protocol with the loss.\n\n5. **Root cause of the vulnerability**  \n   **Insecure price oracle design**: reliance on a **manipulable on-chain spot price / insufficiently manipulation-resistant pricing source** (e.g., a Curve pool price without adequate TWAP/guardrails and liquidity assumptions), allowing an attacker with flash-loan-sized capital to move the price enough to break the protocol\u2019s collateral/borrow accounting.\n\nIf you want, I can also summarize other (separate) C.R.E.A.M.-related incidents on Ethereum, but the above is the one I\u2019m confident describing accurately.",
