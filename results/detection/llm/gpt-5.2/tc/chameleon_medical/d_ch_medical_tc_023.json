The only external interaction is an optional call to `credential.permit(...)` (LN-23) wrapped in a `try/catch` that ignores failures, followed by an internal `_crossOut(...)` call whose body is empty (LN-29 to LN-31). While ignoring errors from `permit` could be dangerous in a full implementation (e.g., proceeding to `transferFrom` without ensuring allowance), there is no exploitable impact in the provided code because `_crossOut` performs no actions. Likewise, reentrancy from the external `permit` call is not exploitable here because the contract maintains no state and performs no sensitive operations after the call beyond invoking an empty internal function."
