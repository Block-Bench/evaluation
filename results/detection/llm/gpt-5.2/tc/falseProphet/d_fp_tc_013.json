The low-level call in _notifyTransfer (LN-80) is potentially risky from a robustness/DoS perspective for transfers to specific malicious contracts (they can consume gas and cause the transfer to revert), but it does not enable unauthorized fund theft or protocol state manipulation against other users and is not a concrete, profitable exploit against the contract as written."
