There are no state changes, no token transfers, no external value transfers, and no privileged roles or authentication logic to bypass. The try/catch that ignores permit failures does not create an exploitable condition in this snippet because the contract does not subsequently perform any action that could move funds based on an assumed approval/allowance. Any meaningful security properties (e.g., whether msg.sender must equal from, reentrancy safety, transferFrom/locking logic, validation of to/toChainID, etc.) would depend entirely on the missing _anySwapOut implementation, which is not present here and therefore cannot be audited or used as a basis for a concrete exploit in this submission."
