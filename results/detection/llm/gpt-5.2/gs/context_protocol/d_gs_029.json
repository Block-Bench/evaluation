Session signatures are validated per-call using individual call hashes, enabling partial replay. Frontrunners can execute subsets of calls to grief or cause financial loss.",

This prevents nonce-burning/griefing attacks.\n- **Reentrancy**: `execute()` is protected by `nonReentrant` and all external calls happen under that guard. `selfExecute()` lacks `nonReentrant`, but it is `onlySelf`, so an external attacker cannot call it directly. Any ability to trigger `selfExecute()` via a batch requires a valid signature for the outer batch (and the inner payload bytes are included in the signed calldata), so this does not create an authorization bypass in the shown code.\n- **Call failure handling**: The revert/abort/ignore logic is consistent and does not appear to allow state inconsistencies exploitable without already-authorized execution.\n\nCaveat: delegatecall is inherently powerful; if `signatureValidation`/session-policy logic (not shown) ever allows a delegatecall to attacker-controlled code, that code can take over the wallet. However, that would be a policy/authorization issue outside the provided code."
