If CREATE2 fails (returns address(0)), it reverts with `DeployFailed`.\n\nStep 3 (things that could go wrong / concerns): I don\u2019t see an obvious security vulnerability in this factory as written\u2014there are no external calls besides CREATE2, and failure is handled. The usual CREATE2 \u201cfront-running\u201d concern (someone else deploying before you) does not let an attacker deploy *different code at the same address* because the CREATE2 address commits to the initCode hash; at worst they can deploy the exact same wallet you were going to deploy, which typically doesn\u2019t compromise ownership (ownership/security should be enforced by the wallet/module logic).\n\nNon-security but important hardening/UX notes to consider:\n- No validation of `_mainModule`: if `_mainModule` is accidentally set to `address(0)` or to an EOA (or the wrong contract), the wallet may be bricked or misconfigured depending on `Wallet`\u2019s constructor expectations. Many factories add a check like `_mainModule.code.length > 0` (and optionally nonzero) to reduce footguns.\n- No event emitted: emitting something like `WalletDeployed(wallet, mainModule, salt)` helps indexers/bundlers and makes debugging easier.\n- No on-chain address prediction helper: not required for correctness (can be computed off-chain), but commonly provided (e.g., `getAddress(mainModule, salt)`) to reduce integration mistakes.\n\nNet: the factory itself looks minimal and correct for deterministic deployment; the main risk surface is whether the wallet constructor/mainModule assumptions are correct and whether callers can accidentally deploy unusable wallets without guardrails."
