Because initcode includes `_mainModule`, the deployed address also depends on `_mainModule`; this is consistent with CREATE2 semantics and not an on-chain exploit.\n- No reentrancy or value-handling issues were found: on failure the function reverts, so ETH is not lost.\n\nNo concrete, exploitable vulnerability exists in the provided Factory code under the stated threat model."
