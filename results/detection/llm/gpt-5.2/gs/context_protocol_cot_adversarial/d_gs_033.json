If CREATE2 returns address(0), it reverts with DeployFailed.\n\nStep 3 (intent vs implementation): The implementation matches a standard deterministic factory pattern:\n- Determinism: Address depends on _salt and the exact init code (including _mainModule), which aligns with the documented goal.\n- Permissionless deployment: Anyone can call deploy, consistent with ERC-4337/bundler deployment patterns.\n- Failure handling: Reverts on failed deployment.\n\nNotes/limits of this sign-off: Only Factory.sol and the two interface files were provided. The security of \u201cthe protocol\u201d also depends heavily on Wallet.sol and the main module\u2019s initialization/authorization model.
