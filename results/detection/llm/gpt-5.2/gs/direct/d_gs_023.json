    "description": "LiquidityBuffer.getControlledBalance() sums balances of managers with isActive == true only. If an admin deactivates a manager via updatePositionManager()/togglePositionManagerStatus() before evacuating funds, any residual underlying on that manager is excluded from the total, causing under-reporting. Moreover, withdrawals from inactive managers are blocked (_withdrawETHFromManager and onlyPositionManagerContract both require the manager to be active), so the funds remain inaccessible until the manager is reactivated.",

    "attack_scenario": "1. Position manager 0 has 1000 ETH allocated to it in Aave\n2. Admin calls togglePositionManagerStatus(0) to deactivate manager 0 without first withdrawing funds\n3. getControlledBalance() now returns a value that is 1000 ETH less than the actual protocol holdings\n4. _withdrawETHFromManager(0, amount) reverts with LiquidityBuffer__ManagerInactive()\n5. The 1000 ETH is effectively locked and invisible to the protocol accounting until admin reactivates the manager",
    "fix_description": "Check underlying balance before deactivation and use a dedicated forceDeactivate() if it's not zero. This was fixed in commit 93280383c0858c559270ceaec6f5d04f9be0a8e7.",

    "overall_explanation": "No externally exploitable vulnerabilities were identified for an unprivileged attacker. All state-changing functions that move ETH (deposit/allocate/withdraw/return/claim/top-up) are gated by AccessControl roles, and the contract rejects direct ETH transfers via receive()/fallback() (except forced ETH via selfdestruct, which does not bypass accounting checks such as pendingPrincipal/pendingInterest). External calls to position managers and staking occur after internal accounting updates, but these calls are only reachable by authorized roles and do not expose a public reentrancy surface to arbitrary users. Potential failure modes observed (e.g., defaultManagerId/positionManagerCount misconfiguration causing depositETH to revert; reliance on correct/benign position managers or staking contract behavior; gas costs of onlyPositionManagerContract loop) are operational/design considerations or require privileged misconfiguration, and do not constitute a concrete exploit path for a non-privileged attacker under the stated assumptions."
