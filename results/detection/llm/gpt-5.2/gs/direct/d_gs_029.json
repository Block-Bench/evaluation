Session signatures are validated per-call using individual call hashes, enabling partial replay. Frontrunners can execute subsets of calls to grief or cause financial loss.",

External execution is also guarded with `nonReentrant`, preventing straightforward reentrancy via arbitrary external calls. `selfExecute()` is restricted by `onlySelf`, and the only way for an untrusted party to reach it is to have a previously-authorized (signed) call sequence invoke it, which does not bypass authorization because the inner payload bytes are still part of the signed outer call data. Delegatecalls are explicitly opt-in per call and are inherently dangerous only if signatures allow delegatecalling to untrusted code; that is an authorization/design concern rather than an exploitable bug in this snippet. No real, permissionless vulnerability leading to loss of funds or unauthorized state manipulation is provable from this code alone."
