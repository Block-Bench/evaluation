However, the formulas `sharesAdded = (amount * totalShares * 1e18) / (pool * price)` and `amount = (sharesAmount * pool * price) / (totalShares * 1e18)` are mathematically consistent for a vault where shares represent a USD-denominated value (price-normalized). The `price` in the deposit formula is in the denominator (lower price = more shares) and in the numerator for withdrawal (higher price = more tokens), which correctly maintains the user's USD value. The model's attack scenario relies on natural market price fluctuations ('Wait for oracle price < 1e18', 'Wait for price to rise'), which is not a vulnerability but intended market exposure. While the code IS vulnerable to flash loan price manipulation (Ground Truth), the model's explanation focuses on a 'formula error' that doesn't exist, rather than the manipulability of the oracle input itself. Therefore, the specific issue identified (incorrect math) does not exist in the code."
