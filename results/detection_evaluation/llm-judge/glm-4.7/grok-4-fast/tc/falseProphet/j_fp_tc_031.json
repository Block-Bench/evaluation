Since the first deposit sets totalSupply > 0, total0 and total1 would have been non-zero at that time. The denominator is the sum of *previous* balances, not current balances. While the share calculation logic is flawed (using sum of balances instead of share value), it does not result in division by zero under the described scenario."

While the code snippet shows empty internal functions for _addLiquidity and _removeLiquidity, the contract is explicitly described as a 'LiquidityHypervisor' implementing 'active liquidity management'. The finding treats the empty internal functions as final implementation proof of vulnerability, ignoring the context that this is a managed vault where the protocol (via rebalance or other mechanisms) is responsible for managing liquidity positions. A user withdrawing without a corresponding remove call would indeed fail, but this is a design characteristic of managed vaults (where users withdraw shares, not underlying liquidity directly), not necessarily a vulnerability causing permanent fund loss if the management functions are implemented correctly."
