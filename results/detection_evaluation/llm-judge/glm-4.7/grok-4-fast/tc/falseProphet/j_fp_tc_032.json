However, the `mintPosition` function (lines 42-45) only returns an incrementing counter (`nftId`) and does not interact with any NFT contract. The `positionNFTs` interface is declared but never initialized or used. Consequently, there is no actual ownership mechanism to bypass; the `_nftId` is merely a numeric identifier used as a mapping key. Since the contract does not implement or enforce NFT ownership, the 'missing check' is not a vulnerability but a reflection of the contract's design (which uses the ID as a key, not an access control token). The attack scenario assumes the existence of an ownership constraint that does not exist in the code."
