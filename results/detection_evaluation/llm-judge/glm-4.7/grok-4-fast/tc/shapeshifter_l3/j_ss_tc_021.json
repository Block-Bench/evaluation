For non-standard ERC20 tokens (like USDT) that return false instead of reverting on failure, this allows an attacker to record collateral balance without actually transferring tokens. This leads to a state manipulation where the user can borrow against fake collateral. The issue exists in the provided code, has a concrete attack scenario, does not require trusted role compromise, and results in a loss of funds. While the Ground Truth focuses on price manipulation, this is a distinct, valid vulnerability."
