The root cause is that the contract uses a single mapping `_0x65ce0c` to track collateral amounts without distinguishing between different token addresses. This allows a user to deposit one asset (e.g., a low-value token) and withdraw a different asset (e.g., a high-value token) up to their total numerical balance. The attack scenario is concrete, step-by-step, and results in a direct loss of funds (theft of other users' deposits). The fix suggested (using a nested mapping for per-asset balances) is technically correct and addresses the issue. This is a valid, exploitable vulnerability not covered by the ground truth."
