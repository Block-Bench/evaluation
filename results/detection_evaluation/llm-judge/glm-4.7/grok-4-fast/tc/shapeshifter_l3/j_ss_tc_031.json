However, this is a mischaracterization of the code's behavior. The share calculation formula `totalSupply * (amount0 + amount1) / (balance0 + balance1)` is a standard proportional allocation mechanism. It does not treat tokens as having equal value; rather, it allocates a percentage of the total pool equal to the percentage of total tokens deposited. If an attacker deposits 1,000,000 tokens when the pool holds 1,001 tokens, they receive 1,000,000/1,001,001 (~99.9%) of the pool. Upon withdrawal, they receive 99.9% of the pool's assets, which is mathematically fair and does not generate a profit or dilute other users disproportionately to their contribution. The model's attack scenario fails because withdrawing 99.9% of the pool yields exactly 99.9% of the value, not a profit. The ground truth vulnerability is 'price_manipulation' via flashloans affecting spot prices, which is a distinct issue requiring external market manipulation, not an internal accounting flaw."
