While `QuantumBridge._0x6ff151` lacks access control, the exploit scenario described (draining victim allowances) requires the victim to have approved the `BridgeHandler` contract. This is a standard ERC20 allowance mechanism, not a vulnerability. The user calls `QuantumBridge` to deposit tokens; `QuantumBridge` calls `BridgeHandler`. The 'drain' scenario is actually the intended functionality of a deposit (transferring user tokens to the bridge).
