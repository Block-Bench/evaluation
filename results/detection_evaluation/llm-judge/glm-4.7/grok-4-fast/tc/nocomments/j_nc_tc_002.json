This allows an attacker to arbitrarily inflate their voting power at zero cost. The attack scenario is concrete and results in unauthorized control over governance and fund drainage. While the ground truth focuses on a flash loan attack (which assumes the deposit function works correctly), this finding exposes a more fundamental flaw that makes the protocol vulnerable even without external liquidity. It meets all BONUS_VALID criteria: exists in code, concrete attack scenario, no trusted role compromise, and genuine impact."
