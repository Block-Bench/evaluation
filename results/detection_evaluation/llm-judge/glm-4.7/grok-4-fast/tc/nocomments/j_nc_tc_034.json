The `deposit` function adds any asset amount to this total, and the `withdraw` function checks this total before transferring out a specific asset. This allows an attacker to deposit a low-value asset and withdraw a high-value asset held by the contract, as demonstrated in the attack scenario. The exploit is concrete, does not require trusted role compromise, and results in loss of funds. This is a different vulnerability than the TARGET price manipulation issue."
