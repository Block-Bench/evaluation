However, the code includes `initialized = true` (line 55) and `initWallet` clears owners (lines 39-42) before adding new ones. If called on an already initialized proxy, the attacker would need to be an existing owner to pass the `isOwner` check in `execute` to call `initWallet` (if `execute` is the entry point), or `initWallet` would simply reset the proxy's state to the attacker's control *if* they could call it. The critical flaw in the code is actually that `initWallet` is public and can be called directly on the *Library* contract itself (not the proxy), allowing an attacker to become the owner of the Library and then call `kill` to destroy the shared logic. The model's scenario describes a proxy takeover (which is mitigated by the `initialized` flag logic if called via delegatecall, or requires owner access if not), missing the actual library selfdestruct vulnerability."
