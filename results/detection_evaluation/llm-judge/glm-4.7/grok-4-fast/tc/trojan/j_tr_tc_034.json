This allows an attacker to deposit a large amount of a low-value token to inflate their balance, then withdraw a smaller amount (in raw units) of a high-value token (like WBTC) deposited by another user. The attack scenario is concrete, step-by-step, and results in direct theft of funds. The fix suggestion (per-asset accounting) is correct."

While the `PoolOracle` implementation ignores this parameter and returns a pool ratio, the logic error exists. Combined with the lack of per-asset tracking (aggregated deposits), this allows borrowing high-value assets against low-value deposits if the raw amounts align.
