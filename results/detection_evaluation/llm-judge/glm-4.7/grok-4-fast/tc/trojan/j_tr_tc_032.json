There is no mechanism enforcing or tracking ownership of `_nftId` values in the contract state. Since the contract relies on the caller to provide the `_nftId` and tracks shares via `userLendingShares[_nftId][_poolToken]`, the 'ownership' is implicitly defined by possession of the ID. The 'vulnerability' described is actually the intended (albeit poorly designed) behavior of the system: whoever knows the ID controls the position.
