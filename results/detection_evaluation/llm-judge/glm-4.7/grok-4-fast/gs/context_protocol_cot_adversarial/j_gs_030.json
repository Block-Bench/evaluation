However, the code in `_leafHashForBlacklist` takes `encodedBlacklist` as input, which is the slice starting *after* the count has been read (pointer is advanced before the slice is taken). The count is not part of the encoded blacklist data slice passed to the hash function; it is part of the parent node's encoding (the flag byte). The protocol's design separates the flag/count metadata from the data payload for hashing. The finding misinterprets the encoding layout and assumes a bug where the code is functioning as designed. Furthermore, the ground truth vulnerability is a signature replay issue in `hashCallWithReplayProtection`, which is unrelated to this finding."
