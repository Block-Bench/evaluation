When a user deposits, they receive shares based on the new, higher asset base. This means they get *fewer* shares per asset deposited, effectively donating value to *existing* shareholders, not diluting them or profiting at the protocol's expense. The 'first depositor profits' scenario described is backwards; the first depositor would be the one diluted by a pre-existing donation. The finding relies on incorrect economic logic."
