However, the provided code shows that `IMidasRedemptionVaultGateway.withdraw(uint256 amount)` is an external interface defined in an imported file (`IMidasRedemptionVaultGateway`). The adapter correctly implements this interface as defined. The finding assumes the gateway interface is incorrect or incomplete without evidence from the provided code. Furthermore, the finding misidentifies the location as `_withdraw` (internal helper) rather than `withdrawPhantomToken` (the user-facing function where the mismatch logic exists). The actual vulnerability is that `withdrawPhantomToken` does not verify that the phantom token's underlying matches the actual pending redemption's output token, not that the gateway interface lacks a parameter."
