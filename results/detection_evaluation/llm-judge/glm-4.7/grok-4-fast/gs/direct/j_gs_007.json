However, the third argument is an override for the global reward growth (rewardGrowthGlobalX128). Passing 0 instructs the function to use 0 as the global value for the calculation, which typically results in calculating the growth inside the range *relative to zero*, not a historical low value. The actual issue in the code is that deposit does not call updateRewardsGrowthGlobal before capturing the initial state, potentially using stale global data, but the specific mechanism described (passing 0 causing underestimation) is a misunderstanding of the function's interface. Furthermore, the ground truth vulnerability is in _claimFees sweeping balances, which is entirely unrelated to this finding."
