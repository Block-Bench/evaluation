This effectively snapshots the user's accrued rewards as 0 at deposit time. When `_earned` calculates rewards, it computes the difference between the current global growth and this 0 baseline, allowing the user to claim rewards that accrued historically before they deposited. This is a concrete exploit with financial impact (draining rewards), distinct from the ground truth issue."

The reward distribution mechanism in `_earned` is capped by `rewardReserve`. While the rate calculation might not explicitly include the rollover term in the numerator (it uses `rewardAmount`), the reserve ensures the funds are available for distribution. The finding mischaracterizes the accounting logic as a loss of funds or stuck state, whereas the funds remain in the reserve to be distributed according to the pool's mechanics.
