The check `rewardRate <= balance / DURATION` ensures the new rate doesn't exceed what the current balance can support for the duration. If claims reduce the balance, the new reward notification might result in a lower rate or require more funds, but it is not a vulnerability that 'halts new reward distribution' in a way that breaks the protocol logic\u2014it enforces solvency.
