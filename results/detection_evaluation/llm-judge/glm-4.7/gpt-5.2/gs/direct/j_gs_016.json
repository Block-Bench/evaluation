This meets the criteria for BONUS_VALID: the vulnerability exists (checking instantaneous balance), there is a concrete attack scenario (flash loan -> create proposal -> repay), it does not require a trusted role compromise, and the impact is genuine (bypassing governance gating). While the location matches the ground truth, the root cause (flash loan susceptibility vs frozen token usability) is different, so it is not a TARGET_MATCH."
