Since `liquidityBuffer` is used in `totalControlled()` to calculate exchange rates, a malicious implementation can manipulate `getAvailableBalance()` and `cumulativeDrawdown()` to manipulate the mETH/ETH rate. This allows for an attack where the attacker mints a large amount of mETH by spoofing a low total controlled value, then redeems it for a large amount of ETH by spoofing a high total controlled value. The vulnerability exists in the provided code, has a concrete attack scenario, and results in fund loss.
