This allows manipulation of the mETH/ETH exchange rate (enabling theft via inflated unstake requests) or denial of service (by causing reverts). The attack scenario is concrete, does not require compromising a trusted role (it exploits the missing access control), and the impact is critical (fund loss or protocol halt)."
