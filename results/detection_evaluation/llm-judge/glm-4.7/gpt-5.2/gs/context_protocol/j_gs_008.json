This causes the share calculation to use an inflated total asset value, resulting in the user receiving fewer shares than they are entitled to (dilution). The root cause is the order of operations: `deposit_for` (which updates `totalAssets`) happens before `calculateShares`. The attack scenario is concrete and demonstrates value transfer from new depositors to existing shareholders. The fix suggestion (using pre-deposit totals) is correct. This is a valid, distinct vulnerability not covered in the ground truth."
