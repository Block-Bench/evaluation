The attack scenario is concrete: an attacker can front-run the legitimate setup, binding the LockManager to a malicious contract that implements the required ERC165 interfaces. This malicious plugin can then revert calls to `unlock()` (specifically within `_withdrawActiveVotingPower`), causing a permanent denial of service and trapping user funds.
