If `TOKEN` is a fee-on-transfer token, the contract's internal accounting (`_balances`, `_totalSupply`) will be inflated relative to the actual token balance. This allows an attacker to deposit fee-on-transfer tokens (getting credited for more than received) and later withdraw the full credited amount, draining the difference from other users' funds. The attack scenario is concrete, step-by-step, and results in a loss of funds. This is a different vulnerability than the ground truth (which concerns emergency withdrawal reward loss), so it qualifies as BONUS_VALID."
