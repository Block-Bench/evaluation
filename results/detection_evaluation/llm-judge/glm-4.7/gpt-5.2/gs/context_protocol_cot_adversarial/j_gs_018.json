In standard counter patterns (like ERC721/ERC20 `_currentIndex`), `currentRequestId()` typically returns the ID that *will be assigned* to the next request (or the count of existing requests). If the Midas vault follows this pattern, the code is correct. The finding hallucinates a specific, non-standard behavior of the external Midas contract (`currentRequestId()` returning the *last* created ID) without evidence, and constructs a vulnerability scenario based on this assumption. The 'cross-user claim' scenario relies entirely on this unproven assumption about external contract semantics. Furthermore, the finding does not match the ground truth root cause (rejected request handling)."
