In the intended architecture, the `LockManager` (which holds the tokens and knows the balances) is the entity granted this permission. The `LockManager` calls `plugin.vote()` internally, passing the user's actual locked balance. Therefore, the caller is trusted (it is the LockManager), and the parameter is not user-supplied but manager-supplied. While a compromised LockManager is a risk, the design of passing the balance as an argument to avoid external calls (reentrancy/gas) is a valid architectural choice, not a vulnerability in the plugin itself."

However, this is a design choice to ensure that a specific set of actions and metadata (the 'intent') maps to a unique proposal ID. If parameters like dates change, the proposal ID remains the same, effectively updating the proposal parameters rather than creating a duplicate. The code explicitly checks `if (_proposalExists(proposalId)) { revert ProposalAlreadyExists(proposalId); }`. This prevents duplicate proposals with the same intent. While it restricts flexibility (e.g., cannot have two active proposals with identical actions but different dates), this is a governance design decision to prevent spam/confusion, not a security vulnerability."
