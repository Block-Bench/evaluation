This is a distinct, concrete vulnerability from the ground truth (signature replay in `execute`). The exploit path is valid: `delegatecall` preserves `msg.sender` as the wallet itself, satisfying `onlySelf`, and allows arbitrary execution without consuming nonces or checking signatures. The impact is a bypass of access controls and reentrancy guards."
