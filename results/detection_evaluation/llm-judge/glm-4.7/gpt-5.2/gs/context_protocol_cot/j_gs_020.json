This allows any user observing a transaction in the mempool to front-run or steal the quote by submitting it through the same router. The root cause (binding to `sender` instead of a specific trader) is different from the ground truth (missing `chainId` in domain separator). The issue exists in the code, has a concrete attack scenario (mempool front-running), and results in loss of execution/funds for the victim. Therefore, it qualifies as a BONUS_VALID finding."
