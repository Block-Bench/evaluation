The issue involves unbounded iteration over `knownProposalIds` in `_withdrawActiveVotingPower`, which can cause `unlock()` to fail due to gas limits if the proposal set grows too large. This is a real, concrete vulnerability with a valid attack scenario (gas griefing preventing withdrawals) that does not require compromising a trusted role. The suggested fixes (per-user tracking, pagination, or bounded loops) are technically sound. Therefore, this qualifies as a BONUS_VALID finding."
