If the staking token is deflationary or charges a transfer fee, the contract will credit more than it receives. The attack scenario is concrete: an attacker can deposit a fee-on-transfer token, be credited for the full amount, and later withdraw the full credited amount, draining the difference from other users' funds. This meets all BONUS_VALID criteria: it exists in the code, has a concrete exploit scenario, does not require a compromised admin role, and results in fund loss."
