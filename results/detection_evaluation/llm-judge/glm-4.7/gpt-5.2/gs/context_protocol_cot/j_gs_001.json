The attack scenario demonstrates a concrete exploit: an attacker deposits when idle HYBR is excluded from the share price calculation (getting more shares than fair value), then calls `receivePenaltyReward` to force that idle HYBR into the veNFT (increasing total assets without minting new shares), and finally withdraws to steal value from existing holders. This meets the criteria for BONUS_VALID as it is a real, exploitable vulnerability not covered in the ground truth."
