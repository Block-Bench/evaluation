This allows anyone to call it first after an upgrade and set the `liquidityBuffer` address. Since `liquidityBuffer` is used in `totalControlled()` to calculate exchange rates, a malicious contract could manipulate these rates. The attack scenario is concrete: an attacker calls `initializeV2`, sets a malicious buffer, stakes mETH, and calls `unstakeRequest` which records an inflated `ethRequested` based on the manipulated rate. This is a distinct vulnerability from the ground truth (which concerns rate fixing and socialization of losses in `_unstakeRequest`), so it qualifies as BONUS_VALID."
