This allows an attacker to drain the pool's actual ERC20 balance without depositing anything, as the internal accounting (`tokens[token].balance`) is incremented while the external balance remains unchanged (or decreases when sending `amountOut`). The attack scenario is concrete, step-by-step, and results in a loss of funds. It does not require privileged roles. This is a different vulnerability than the TARGET pool manipulation issue."
