The model correctly identifies that the `manager` field in the `Campaign` struct is user-controlled and not validated against `msg.sender`. This allows an attacker to front-run or squat on campaign IDs by setting the manager to an uncontrolled address (e.g., a burn address), causing a permanent Denial of Service for that ID. The issue exists in the code (LN-61, LN-85), has a concrete attack scenario, does not require compromising a privileged role, and has genuine impact (state manipulation/DoS). Therefore, it qualifies as BONUS_VALID."
