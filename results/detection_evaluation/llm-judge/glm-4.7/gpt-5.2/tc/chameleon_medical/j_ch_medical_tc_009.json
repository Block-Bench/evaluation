The root cause is that the contract calls `credential.transfer(address(this), quantity)`, which transfers tokens from the contract to itself (a no-op for balance), yet it updates the internal accounting (`contributedAmount` and `totalamountContributedamount`) as if it received tokens. This allows an attacker to mint internal credits for any asset the contract already holds (e.g., pre-funded or accidentally sent tokens) and then drain them via `dischargeFunds`. The attack scenario is concrete, step-by-step, and results in a loss of funds. This is a different vulnerability than the TARGET reentrancy issue in `dischargeFunds`, so it qualifies as BONUS_VALID."
