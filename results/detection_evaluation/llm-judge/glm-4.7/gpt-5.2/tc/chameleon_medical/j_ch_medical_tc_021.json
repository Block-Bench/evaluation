The code uses `IERC20.transferFrom` without checking the return value and credits the user's position based on the `quantity` parameter rather than the actual amount received. This allows an attacker to deposit fee-on-transfer tokens (or non-compliant tokens) and be credited for more collateral than actually transferred, leading to potential draining of the lending pool via `requestAdvance`. This is a distinct vulnerability from the ground truth (price oracle manipulation) and meets all BONUS_VALID criteria: it exists in the code, has a concrete attack scenario, does not require trusted role compromise, and has genuine impact."
