However, the code uses `userLendingShares[_nftId][_poolToken]` to track shares. The `mintPosition` function returns an ID, but the contract relies on the secrecy of the `_nftId` (possession-based security) rather than on-chain ownership tracking. While this is a weak design pattern (security by obscurity), it is not a broken access control vulnerability in the traditional sense because the contract does not claim to implement ERC721 ownership logic (the `positionNFTs` interface is declared but never used). An attacker cannot simply 'discover' a valid `_nftId` with non-zero shares without the user revealing it, and the contract functions as designed for the holder of the ID. This is a design choice/weakness, not a direct exploit path as described."

This is a theoretical concern that depends on external factors (the specific token implementation) rather than a vulnerability in the contract logic itself for standard tokens. The ground truth vulnerability (arithmetic rounding error) is a concrete, high-severity issue inherent to the contract's math logic.
