This allows an attacker to deposit LP tokens for a pair where one token has a high raw value (e.g., WETH) and borrow against it as if that raw value were in stablecoin units. While the Ground Truth focuses on flash loan price manipulation of reserves, this finding identifies a distinct, fundamental flaw in the valuation logic that exists independently of reserve manipulation. The attack scenario is concrete, requires no privileged access, and results in fund drainage. Therefore, it qualifies as BONUS_VALID."
