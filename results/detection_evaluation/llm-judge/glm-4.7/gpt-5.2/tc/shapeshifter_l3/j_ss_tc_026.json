Given the arguments `(msg.sender, address(this), amount)`, this is semantically a `transfer` call (from contract to user), not a `transferFrom` (pulling from user). Since the contract is minting shares to the user, it should be sending tokens *to* the user (yield), not pulling them. The finding claims the contract 'pulls tokens in' and ignores the return, but the code structure suggests it is pushing tokens out. Therefore, the 'unchecked return value' on a push operation does not allow 'minting shares without transferring tokens' as claimed. The finding describes a scenario that does not match the code's logic."
