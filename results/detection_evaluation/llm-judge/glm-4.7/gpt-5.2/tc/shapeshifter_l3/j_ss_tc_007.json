When `_0x2ff8d2` reaches 1 or -1, the division results in 0, causing the loop to stall indefinitely. This is a valid logic error (DoS) that exists in the provided code, has a concrete attack scenario (any swap with odd amounts eventually gets stuck), and causes a critical failure (gas exhaustion/revert). It is not a hallucination, design choice, or security theater. While it shares the function `_0x6273a6` with the ground truth, the root cause (infinite loop due to division by 2 vs arithmetic overflow/underflow in liquidity tracking) and vulnerability type are completely different, qualifying it as a BONUS_VALID finding."
