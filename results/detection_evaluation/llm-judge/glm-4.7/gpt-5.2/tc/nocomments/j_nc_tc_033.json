If the contract holds any `mkUSD` balance (e.g., from accidental transfers or previous operations), an attacker can specify `debtAmount` equal to the contract's balance and `collateralAmount` of 0 to drain the funds. This is a concrete, exploitable vulnerability with a clear attack scenario and financial impact (loss of funds). While the Ground Truth focuses on the access control issue regarding the `account` parameter, this finding highlights a separate, distinct logic flaw in the fund transfer mechanism. Therefore, it qualifies as BONUS_VALID."
