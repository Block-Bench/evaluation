The maximum value of `uint128` is `2^128 - 1`, which is exactly `type(int128).max`. When cast to `int128` (line 61), this becomes the maximum positive integer. Adding this to `liquidityNet` (initialized to 0) would cause an overflow in Solidity 0.8+, reverting the transaction. The attacker cannot successfully set `liquidityNet` to the saturation point because the operation itself reverts. Therefore, the attack scenario is impossible."
