This allows an attacker to inflate balances arbitrarily and manipulate the `isComplete()` condition. The vulnerability exists in the code, has a concrete attack scenario (repeated calls to mint tokens to multiple addresses then consolidate), results in critical state manipulation (solving the challenge), and does not require compromising a trusted role.
