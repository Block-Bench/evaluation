Converting fees to LP tokens increases the owner's liquidity position, which they own. The beneficiary's share is a percentage of *claimed* fees, not a percentage of the contract's total balance at all times. Since the owner controls the locker and the LP tokens, using accumulated fees to mint more LP tokens does not bypass the beneficiary's share logic\u2014it merely changes the form of the owner's retained value from tokens to LP tokens. The beneficiary's share is only calculated and deducted when fees are explicitly claimed via `_claimFees` or `_collectFees`. This is a mischaracterization of intended functionality, not a vulnerability."
