If `addr` is 0, the condition `addr != address(0)` is false, so the `&&` short-circuits and the revert is NOT triggered. The function then returns `(true, opHash)`. While this behavior (treating an unset static signature as valid) might be a design flaw, the finding's logic about the check passing is correct, but the classification as a vulnerability is weak because `isValidSignature` returning true for an unset hash is only exploitable if the system relies on the absence of a signature as a denial mechanism, which is not the standard use case.
