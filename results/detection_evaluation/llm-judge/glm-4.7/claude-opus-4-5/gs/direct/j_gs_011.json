However, the code in `vote()` (lines 147-159) correctly handles the case where `votingPower` is 0 by returning early if the new voting power is also 0, or calculating the difference if it increases. The logic relies on `votingPower` being the source of truth for whether a vote is active, not `voteOption`. The scenario described (voting a different option after clearing) correctly enters the 'different option' branch because `voteOption` (Yes) != `VoteOption.None`, and the old power (0) is subtracted (no-op) before adding the new power. The tally remains consistent. This is a misunderstanding of the code logic rather than a vulnerability."
