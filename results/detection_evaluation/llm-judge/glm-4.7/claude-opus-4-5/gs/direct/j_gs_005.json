However, the code logic shows that `_totalVoteWeight` is only summed from pools where `gaugeManager.isGaugeAliveForPool(_pool)` is true. The subsequent loop that performs the division iterates over the same pools and checks `if (gaugeManager.isGaugeAliveForPool(_pool))` before calculating `_poolWeight`. Therefore, if `_totalVoteWeight` is 0, the loop body is never entered, and the division is never reached. The transaction would simply complete with `totalWeight` unchanged (or effectively reset to 0 if `_reset` was called). This is not a vulnerability, just a no-op scenario."

The `poke` function is specifically designed to update votes to reflect the *current* (decayed or increased) balance of the veNFT. In ve(3,3) systems, voting power is dynamic and tied to the current state of the lock. The `onlyNewEpoch` restriction applies to *changing* vote distribution (allocating to different pools), not to updating the weight of existing allocations to match the current balance. The `poke` function correctly uses `IVotingEscrow(_ve).balanceOfNFT(_tokenId)` to fetch the current weight. This is intended behavior, not a vulnerability."
