The scenario described (double claiming due to stale balance) is an accounting logic issue regarding how `allocatedBalance` is updated, not a reentrancy attack. Furthermore, the `IPositionManager` is a trusted contract managed by the protocol, and the described 'attack' requires the `INTEREST_TOPUP_ROLE`, which is a privileged role. The finding mischaracterizes the issue as reentrancy when it is actually a design choice regarding when to update `allocatedBalance` (which is updated on principal deposits/withdrawals, not interest claims)."
