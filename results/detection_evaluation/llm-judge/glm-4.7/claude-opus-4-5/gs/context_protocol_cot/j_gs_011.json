When `voteOption` is set but `votingPower` is 0, the 'Same vote' branch calculates `diff = _newVotingPower - 0`, which correctly adds the new voting power. The 'Different vote' branch subtracts 0 from the old tally, which is also correct. The state is not inconsistent in a way that causes incorrect tallying or fund loss. This is a minor code style observation, not a security vulnerability."

This is an intentional design choice to ensure proposal uniqueness and prevent duplicate execution of the same intent. While it creates a UX limitation (needing to modify metadata to re-propose), it is not a security vulnerability that leads to fund loss or unauthorized access. The 'front-running' scenario described requires the attacker to have `CREATE_PROPOSAL_PERMISSION`, which is a trusted role, and the result is simply a failed proposal, not an exploit."

The LockManager is the trusted intermediary handling user interactions. If the LockManager has execute permissions, it is acting as intended.
