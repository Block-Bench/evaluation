The `isGranted` function relies on `token.balanceOf(_who)`, which can be manipulated via flash loans within a single transaction. An attacker can borrow tokens to meet the `minProposerVotingPower` threshold, create a proposal, and repay the loan immediately, bypassing the intent of requiring genuine skin-in-the-game. The attack scenario is concrete, step-by-step, and results in unauthorized access (spam proposals). The fix suggested (removing `token.balanceOf` and relying only on locked tokens) is technically correct and addresses the issue."

However, the provided code (LockManagerBase) implements a custodial model: `_lock` calls `_doLockTransfer` (transferring tokens to the manager), and `getLockedBalance` returns the internal `lockedBalances` mapping. In a standard ERC20 custodial lock, the user's `balanceOf` decreases as the manager's balance increases. Therefore, the same tokens are not counted twice. The finding relies on a hypothetical implementation that contradicts the provided code context."
