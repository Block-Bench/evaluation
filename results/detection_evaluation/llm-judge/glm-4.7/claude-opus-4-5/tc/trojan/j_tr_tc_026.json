However, the code at line 51 uses `pool * price` in the denominator. If an attacker donates tokens to inflate `pool`, the denominator increases, resulting in the *victim receiving fewer shares*, not more. The attacker's share ownership percentage would actually *decrease* as a result of the donation, making this attack scenario mathematically impossible for profit.
