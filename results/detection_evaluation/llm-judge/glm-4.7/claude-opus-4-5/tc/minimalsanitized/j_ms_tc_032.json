Therefore, the attacker would only withdraw their proportional share of the total pool (their 1 share vs the inflated pool), not the victim's funds. The math does not support the claim that the victim's deposit is stolen; the victim would receive fewer shares but still own a proportional percentage of the pool. The scenario fails to demonstrate a profitable exploit."
