The ground truth implies the vulnerability is that miners/users can predict the hash of the next block, whereas the model found that waiting >256 blocks forces the hash to zero. Both are valid exploits of the `blockhash` opcode in this context, but they are technically distinct vulnerabilities. Since the prerequisite (root cause match) failed, this cannot be a TARGET_MATCH or PARTIAL_MATCH. It is classified as BONUS_VALID because the zero-exploit is a real, high-severity vulnerability not covered by the ground truth description.",
