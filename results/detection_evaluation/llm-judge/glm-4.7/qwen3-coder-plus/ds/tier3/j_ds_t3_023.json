Creating a pending transaction requires calling `execute`, which requires `msg.sender` to be an owner (`onlyowner` modifier). An attacker cannot spam the pending state without being an owner. If an attacker is an owner, they already have significant control over the wallet, making this a 'griefing' scenario by an insider rather than a vulnerability exploitable by an external attacker. The finding lacks a concrete, profitable exploit scenario that doesn't require compromising a trusted role."
