In reality, the ground truth vulnerability is that ecrecover can return address(0) for invalid signatures (v != 27/28). Since Admin is address(0), an attacker can bypass the signature check by providing invalid signature parameters (e.g., v=0), causing ecrecover to return address(0) which matches Admin.
