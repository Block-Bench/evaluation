The `exchangeAdjustmentRate` is intended to create a spread (fee) during minting (`ethToMETH`) to protect existing users from dilution during volatile periods or specific protocol conditions, while burning/redemption (`mETHToETH`) typically reflects the actual share of assets. The 'inconsistency' is the intended mechanism for the spread. Furthermore, the attack scenario is flawed: a user cannot 'redeem more ETH than they should' because the `mETHToETH` calculation determines the claimable amount based on the actual total assets controlled. If they received fewer mETH due to the adjustment rate, their claim on the total assets is proportionally smaller. There is no arbitrage loop that allows extracting more value than deposited because the minting penalty (spread) is a one-way cost. The finding misinterprets an intentional economic parameter as a logic error."
