This is consistent with the business model where unstaked fees are incentives for liquidity providers to stake in gauges; if the gauge is dead/inactive, there is no incentive mechanism to penalize. The finding interprets the lack of a fee as a revenue loss bug, but this appears to be the intended design logic (no gauge = no unstaked fee). The finding mischaracterizes a design choice as a vulnerability."
