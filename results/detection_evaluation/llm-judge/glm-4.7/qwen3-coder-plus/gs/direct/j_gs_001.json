However, the code includes a require statement `require(hybrAmount <= veBalance, \"Insufficient veNFT balance\")` which prevents the underflow scenario described. Furthermore, the `multiSplit` function in standard VotingEscrow implementations (like Curve's) is trusted to return the correct amounts corresponding to the inputs; the contract's logic of assigning the first returned ID to the contract and the second to the user is standard for splitting NFTs. The finding does not demonstrate a concrete exploit where a user withdraws more than their share, as the share calculation (`calculateAssets`) and the `hybrAmount` check enforce the limit. This appears to be a mischaracterization of standard behavior as a vulnerability."

The function effectively allows anyone to donate HYBR to the pool. In a liquid staking wrapper, allowing public deposits (donations) that increase the share value for all existing holders is often an intended feature or at least a benign design choice, not a vulnerability. The finding claims it allows \"manipulating tokenomics\" or \"wasting gas,\" but these are not concrete security vulnerabilities resulting in loss of funds or unauthorized access.
