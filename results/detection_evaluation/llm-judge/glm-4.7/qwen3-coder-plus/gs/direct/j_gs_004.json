The finding misidentifies the initialization logic as a vulnerability. The actual vulnerability (first depositor donation attack) requires an attacker to manipulate the ratio *after* the first deposit by inflating `totalAssets` (via `receivePenaltyReward` or direct transfers) before a victim deposits, causing the victim's share calculation to round down to zero. The finding does not identify this root cause or the lack of `shares > 0` check."
