This is incorrect. The code allocates a maximum size array (`new SessionPermissions[](maxPermissionsSize)`) and then populates elements sequentially via `sig.sessionPermissions[permissionsCount++] = nodePermissions`. The assembly block correctly truncates the array length to the number of elements actually populated (`permissionsCount`). This is a standard optimization pattern in Solidity to avoid multiple memory allocations. The array elements accessed during validation (indices 0 to permissionsCount-1) are fully initialized.
