However, in the Aragon plugin architecture, `EXECUTE_PROPOSAL_PERMISSION_ID` is a permission granted on the plugin to authorize execution of proposals managed by that plugin. The check `dao().hasPermission(address(this), ...)` correctly verifies if the caller has permission to perform actions on the plugin contract (`address(this)`). The finding misunderstands the permission model of the framework, and there is no concrete exploit scenario where an unauthorized user can execute proposals solely due to this check structure."

However, `_canVote` is an `internal view` function called synchronously within the same transaction context as the state updates. It is not possible for the `lockManager.getLockedBalance` to change between the check and the update without an external call (reentrancy) in between, which does not exist in this flow. The parameter `_newVotingPower` is passed from `LockManager.vote`, which retrieves it from `getLockedBalance`.
