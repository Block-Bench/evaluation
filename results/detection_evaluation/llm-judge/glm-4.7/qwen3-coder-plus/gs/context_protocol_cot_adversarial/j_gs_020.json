However, `exchangeRateDenom` is part of the `hookData` which is signed by the `quoteSigner` in `beforeSwap`. If a malicious user provides a zero denominator, the signature verification in `beforeSwap` will fail because the signer would not have signed a quote with invalid parameters. The signature check binds the parameters to the signer's intent, preventing an attacker from unilaterally causing a revert with invalid data. This is a design feature (off-chain validation via signature), not a vulnerability."
