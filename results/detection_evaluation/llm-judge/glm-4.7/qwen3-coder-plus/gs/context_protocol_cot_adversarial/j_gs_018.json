However, `requestRedeem` is marked `nonReentrant`, which prevents reentrancy. Furthermore, the Midas vault's `currentRequestId` is typically a counter that increments *after* a request is successfully created. The `redeemRequest` call is synchronous; if it succeeds, it returns the ID associated with that specific transaction. The model hallucinates a race condition where the ID changes mid-execution without a reentrant call or external state change mechanism that would increment the counter before the function completes."

This ensures that only the address that has an active pending redemption (the one stored in the mapping) can withdraw. The check `if (sender != address(this))` validates the request belongs to the Gateway, but the mapping lookup ensures the caller is the user who initiated the request.
