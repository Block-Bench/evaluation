However, the function is protected by `auth(LOCK_MANAGER_PERMISSION_ID)`, meaning only the authorized `LockManager` (a trusted component in the protocol architecture) can call it. The `LockManager` correctly retrieves the user's locked balance via `getLockedBalance` and passes it to `vote`. This is a design pattern where the validation is delegated to the authorized caller. The finding incorrectly characterizes this architectural separation as a vulnerability, assuming the function can be called directly by arbitrary users or that the LockManager is compromised, which falls outside the scope of standard contract security (trusted role compromise)."
