The attack scenario is concrete: an attacker can add a malicious token with a high weight (e.g., 90%) to the pool. Since `addToken` sets the weight directly and `_updateWeights` recalculates weights based on balances, an attacker could add a token, manipulate its balance via `addLiquidity`, and significantly skew the pool's weights. This allows draining value from other tokens via swaps. The issue is not a hallucination, design choice, or out of scope."
