The actual root cause is the lack of reentrancy protection combined with insufficient market validation (registerMarket), not a disabled guard. Since the root cause does not match the ground truth (which specifies missing guards and insufficient validation, not a disabled toggle), it cannot be a TARGET_MATCH or PARTIAL_MATCH."
