This is a design choice (the contract operates on the new token despite the variable name), not a logic error where the code fails to do what was intended.

However, this is an intentional design choice for a public sweep function, not necessarily a vulnerability. The function includes a check `require(token != underlying, \"Cannot sweep underlying token\")` to protect the main asset. Allowing anyone to sweep random tokens sent to the contract is a common pattern to prevent the contract from getting stuck with dust or airdropped tokens. Without a specific scenario where this causes loss of user funds (since the underlying is protected), this is classified as a design choice rather than a security vulnerability."
