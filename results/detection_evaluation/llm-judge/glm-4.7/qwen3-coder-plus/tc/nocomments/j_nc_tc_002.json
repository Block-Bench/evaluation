Even if reentrancy occurs, `prop.executed` is still `false` during the callback, so the check passes. The critical check preventing double voting is `hasVoted[proposalId][msg.sender]` (line 77), which is set to `true` when the proposal is created (line 69) or when a vote is cast (line 81). Since the attacker has already voted (either as proposer or voter), `hasVoted` is true, and the reentrancy call to `vote()` will revert with 'Already voted'. Therefore, the attack scenario described is impossible."
