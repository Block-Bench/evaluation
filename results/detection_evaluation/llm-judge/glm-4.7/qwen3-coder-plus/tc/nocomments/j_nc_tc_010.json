In reality, the code updates the debt state *before* the external call (lines 60-61), so re-entering borrow() would fail the health check due to the already increased debt. The actual ground truth root cause is cross-function reentrancy where the attacker calls exitMarket() during the callback to bypass the final health check (line 66) by modifying the inMarket state. The model's explanation describes a standard reentrancy pattern that does not exist in this specific code structure."
