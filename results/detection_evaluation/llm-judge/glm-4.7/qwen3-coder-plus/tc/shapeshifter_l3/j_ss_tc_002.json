The finding mischaracterizes the ability to deposit tokens as a vulnerability (arbitrary manipulation). While the finding correctly identifies that voting power is derived from current balances (which is the actual root cause of the flash loan vulnerability), it frames this as a bug in the deposit function rather than a design flaw in the governance mechanism regarding time-weighting. Furthermore, the attack scenario describes 'double-spending' voting power across proposals, which is not the critical issue described in the ground truth (flash loan governance attack). The ground truth vulnerability is about using flash loans to gain temporary majority voting power to execute a proposal immediately, not about inflating votes across multiple proposals."
