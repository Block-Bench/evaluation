The actual issue is that the interface definition is incomplete/malformed (using selector names instead of standard names), but the call itself targets the `transferFrom` selector (0x23b872dd -> 0x0cce35 in the obfuscated context). The model identifies a mismatch between the interface definition and the call site, which is a code quality issue, but asserts it causes a runtime failure ('users funds are stuck') which is a mischaracterization of how Solidity interface calls work against deployed ERC20 contracts.
