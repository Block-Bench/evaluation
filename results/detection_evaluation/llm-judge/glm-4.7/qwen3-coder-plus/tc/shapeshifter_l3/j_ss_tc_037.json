Standard ERC20 implementations do not allow reentrancy during a transferFrom call to the recipient (the contract). The subsequent ETH transfer on line 51 sends ETH to the user, but this is a simple transfer, not an external call to a user-controlled contract that would trigger a fallback function capable of re-entering. The attack scenario describes re-entering during a transfer, which is technically impossible for standard ETH transfers."
