In reality, the target address (_0xd6cb4d) is hardcoded to _0x6ff151 (set in constructor) and is not user-controllable. The actual root cause is that the Manager allows executing privileged functions on the trusted Data contract (which it owns) without restricting the target contract, creating an access control bypass. The model's explanation of '_0xd6cb4d is derived from _0x6ff151' is technically correct but it fails to identify the specific access control bypass scenario involving the trusted Data contract."
