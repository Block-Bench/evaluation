The location (`YieldStrategy`) does not match the ground truth location (`YieldController.swapExactJarForJar`), so it cannot be a TARGET_MATCH. However, it is a valid, distinct vulnerability (BONUS_VALID) because it exists in the code, has a concrete attack scenario, and results in a loss of funds."
