This enables an attacker to map a resourceID to address(0) or a malicious contract. While the ground truth focuses on the lack of address(0) validation in deposit, the missing access control on setResource is a distinct, concrete vulnerability that facilitates the attack (or allows other attacks) and exists in the code.

Finding 1 focuses on 'zero amount' validation and generic 'properly configured' checks without mentioning the critical address(0) bypass or the silent success of transferFrom on zero address.
