Consequently, the loops iterate over `address(0)` values, ignoring actual user deposits in `patientPayments` and `patientBorrows`. This breaks the collateral calculation logic, allowing borrowers to bypass limits. The issue is not a design choice, hallucinated, or out of scope. It is a distinct vulnerability from the ground truth (price oracle manipulation), so it qualifies as BONUS_VALID."
