The `submitPayment` function updates state (`patientAccountcreditsmap`) *before* the external call (if we assume `transferFrom` is the external call, though it's the first line, the state update follows immediately). More critically, `dischargeFunds` performs state updates *before* the external `transfer` call, following the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern. Therefore, the claimed reentrancy vector via these functions is not supported by the code structure.
