The function does not leak data itself; it merely computes a hash. The actual vulnerability is that sensitive data (passwords) is stored on-chain in the first place (in the `constructor`), which makes it readable via storage slots regardless of this helper function. Blaming the helper function is a mischaracterization of the risk."
