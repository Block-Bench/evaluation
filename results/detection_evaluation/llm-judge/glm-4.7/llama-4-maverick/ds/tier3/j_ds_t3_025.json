However, the function is called by `approveAndCall` itself. If the spender contract is malicious, it can call back into `HumanStandardToken.transferFrom` to spend the allowance before `approveAndCall` returns. While this is a known pattern (ERC20 approve-and-call), it does carry risk if the spender is not trusted. The attack scenario is concrete: a malicious spender can drain tokens immediately upon approval. This is a valid vulnerability distinct from the target."
