Additionally, sendFunds returns a boolean which is checked by callers to revert on failure, preventing the state inconsistency required for reentrancy. The use of `send` (limited to 2300 gas) further mitigates reentrancy risk compared to `call`. Thus, the reentrancy vulnerability is effectively non-existent/mischaracterized."
