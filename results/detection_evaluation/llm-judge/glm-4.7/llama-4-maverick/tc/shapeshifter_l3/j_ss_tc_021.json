The debt is not used in any access control or critical check within the same transaction that would allow draining funds. The check `require(_0x65ce0c[msg.sender]._0xe5feba + _0xae3550 <= _0xd6cb4d)` happens before the transfer. Re-entering would fail this check because the debt has already been increased (or is about to be increased) and the collateral value hasn't changed.
