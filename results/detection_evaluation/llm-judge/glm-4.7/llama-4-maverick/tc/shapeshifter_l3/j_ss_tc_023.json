The ground truth specifies that the vulnerability allows bridging tokens without authorization because the permit check is bypassed, whereas the finding focuses on the generic risk of unchecked calls to malicious contracts. Furthermore, the location is incorrect: the ground truth identifies the vulnerability in the context of the permit function `_0x347a3f` (or the logic calling it), but the finding cites `_0x390062` as the vulnerable location. While `_0x390062` contains the try-catch, the ground truth frames the issue around the permit validation failure. More critically, the root cause does not match the specific 'signature verification bypass' scenario."
