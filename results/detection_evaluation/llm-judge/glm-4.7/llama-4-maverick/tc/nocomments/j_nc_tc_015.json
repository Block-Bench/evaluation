The `swap` function updates balances on lines 40 and 50 before transferring on lines 39 and 51. The `addLiquidity` function updates the balance on line 106 before transferring on line 105. This follows the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, making standard reentrancy draining impossible. The scenario relies on a malicious token re-entering, but since the pool's state (balances) is already updated, re-entering `swap` would fail the liquidity check or simply transfer funds back to the pool, not drain it."
