The ground truth issue allows profit via imbalanced deposits regardless of rounding, whereas the finding describes a generic precision issue. The attack scenario provided (getting zero units) does not match the ground truth scenario (getting excess units via averaging). Therefore, this is a mischaracterization of the actual vulnerability."
