In a real deployment, `TestOracle` would be replaced by a production oracle (like Chainlink). The ground truth targets the architectural flaw of relying on low-liquidity DEX spot prices (manipulable via flashloans) in the `LeveragedLending` logic, not the lack of access control on a test mock. Therefore, this is a mischaracterization of the test environment as a production vulnerability."

While this is a bug that breaks the protocol's functionality (preventing borrowing), it is not the TARGET vulnerability (price oracle manipulation). It is a valid, concrete issue in the code (not hallucinated or a design choice), though its impact is denial of service rather than fund theft."
