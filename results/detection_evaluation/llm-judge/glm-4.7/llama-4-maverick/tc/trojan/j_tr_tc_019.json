The actual `require` statement for the K-check (lines 98-102) is NOT inside the `if (unsafeKCheckBypass)` block. Therefore, the K-check is always enforced regardless of the flag's state. The flag is a distractor variable that does not affect the critical validation logic."

The `swap` function uses cached reserves (`_reserve0`, `_reserve1`) for calculations and validation. Reentering the function would use the *old* reserves for the second call's validation, not the manipulated state. The K-check prevents draining value. Without a concrete scenario showing how reentrancy bypasses the K-check or allows theft, this is a theoretical concern rather than an actual vulnerability."
