The `isOwner` check is performed at the start, and the function does not transfer ownership or sensitive state that would make a reentrancy attack profitable.

However, the location specified is `initWallet`, whereas the ground truth specifies the vulnerable function as `kill`. While the finding identifies the prerequisite vulnerability (unprotected init), it does not identify the function (`kill`) that enables the critical impact (selfdestruct). According to the strict evaluation criteria, the location must match the ground truth function(s) for a TARGET_MATCH. Since the root cause is correct but the location is different (init vs kill), this is classified as PARTIAL_MATCH (root cause correct, location incorrect)."
