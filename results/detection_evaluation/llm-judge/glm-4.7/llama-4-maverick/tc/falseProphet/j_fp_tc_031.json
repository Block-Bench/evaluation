However, the code uses standard ERC20 `transfer` calls (lines 109-110), which do not trigger callbacks to the sender's contract. Reentrancy is only possible with tokens like ERC777 or if the contract calls an untrusted external contract. Since the code only interacts with standard ERC20 interfaces and does not invoke external user-controlled logic during the transfer, this is a mischaracterization of a standard Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern rather than a valid vulnerability."
