While the vulnerability originates in `_notifyTransfercare`, the ground truth specifies the vulnerable function as `transfer`. According to the evaluation criteria, the finding must identify the SAME vulnerable function(s) as specified in ground truth. Since the location differs, it cannot be a TARGET_MATCH.
