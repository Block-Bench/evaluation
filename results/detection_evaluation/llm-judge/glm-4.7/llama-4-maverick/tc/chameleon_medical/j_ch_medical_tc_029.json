An attacker can implement `IEmergencyLoanRecipient` and re-enter `emergencyLoan` during the callback to drain funds before the `transferFrom` repayment logic executes. This meets the criteria for BONUS_VALID: it exists in the code, has a concrete attack scenario, does not require trusted role compromise, and results in loss of funds."
