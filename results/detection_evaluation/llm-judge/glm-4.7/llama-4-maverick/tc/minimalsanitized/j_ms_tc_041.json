The finding treats the external call to an arbitrary user-supplied address as a vulnerability requiring reentrancy guards, rather than recognizing that the lack of access control is the design (or the vulnerability if access was intended). The 'reentrancy' concern is mischaracterized because the function does not perform state changes or transfers before/after the call that would make it vulnerable to reentrancy in the traditional sense. The 'unexpected behavior' if the pair doesn't implement the function is a standard revert risk, not a security vulnerability."
