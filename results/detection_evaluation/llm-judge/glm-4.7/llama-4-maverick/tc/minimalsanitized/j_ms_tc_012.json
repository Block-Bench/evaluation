The ground truth identifies a logic error where the sweepToken function fails to block the NEW_TUSD address (the actual underlying asset) because it only checks against OLD_TUSD. The model claims the issue is a lack of access control allowing anyone to drain tokens. However, the function `sweepToken` is intentionally designed to allow anyone to sweep non-underlying tokens (a common pattern to prevent token locking). The vulnerability is not that anyone can sweep, but that the definition of 'underlying' is inconsistent between the `underlying` state variable (OLD_TUSD) and the actual tokens used in `mint`/`redeem` (NEW_TUSD), allowing the actual underlying asset to be swept."

The scenario described (silent failure increasing balance) is highly unlikely for standard tokens on 0.8.0 contracts. This is a theoretical concern without a concrete, profitable exploit scenario in the provided context, classifying it as security theater."
