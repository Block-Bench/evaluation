Finding 0 assumes the caller is already an 'owner' and focuses on the lack of timelocks/multi-sig for the kill function, rather than the fact that *anyone* can become an owner by calling `initWallet` directly on the library.

However, the code sets `initialized = true` at the end of `initWallet`.

The actual issue is that `initWallet` can be called *directly* on the library contract (not via proxy) by *anyone* because it lacks access control, allowing them to overwrite the library's state and become an owner. The finding mischaracterizes the risk as a front-running issue rather than a missing access control issue on a shared library."
