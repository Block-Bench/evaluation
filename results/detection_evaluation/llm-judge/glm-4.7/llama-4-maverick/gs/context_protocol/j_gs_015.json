Furthermore, the `vote` function is protected by `auth(LOCK_MANAGER_PERMISSION_ID)`, meaning only the trusted `LockManager` can call it. The scenario of an attacker crafting a proposal to re-enter and 'drain funds' is not supported by the code logic, as there are no fund transfers in `vote`, and the entry point is permission-gated.
