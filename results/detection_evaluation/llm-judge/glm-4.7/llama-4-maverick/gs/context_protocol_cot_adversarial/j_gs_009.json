However, the contract uses a state-based `nonreentrant` modifier on all state-changing external functions (`deposit_for`, `create_lock`, `withdraw`, `merge`, `multiSplit`, etc.). While `safeTransferFrom` itself is not marked `nonreentrant`, it calls `_transferFrom`, which calls `_removeTokenFrom` and `_addTokenTo`. These functions only modify ERC721 ownership mappings (`idToOwner`, `ownerToNFTokenCount`). They do not modify the escrowed token balances (`locked` mapping) or the `supply` variable, nor do they trigger token transfers. The critical state (funds) is only modified in functions protected by `nonreentrant`. Therefore, a reentrancy attack via `safeTransferFrom` cannot drain funds or manipulate escrow state, making this a mischaracterization of the actual risk."
