However, `_attemptEarlyExecution` only calls `_execute` if `_canExecute` returns true. `_canExecute` checks if the proposal has succeeded (support, participation, approval thresholds) and if the voting period has ended (or early execution conditions are met). A proposal cannot succeed and execute in the same transaction it is voted on because the vote tally is updated before the check, but the participation and support thresholds require a specific distribution of votes that cannot be guaranteed to be met instantly by a single vote, nor can the proposal be 'ended' by a single vote unless it was already at the edge. Even if executed, the execution happens via the DAO executor, not a reentrant callback to `vote`. The state updates (tally) happen before the external call. This is a mischaracterization of standard execution flow as reentrancy."
