If all gauges are dead, the loop doesn't execute, `_totalVoteWeight` remains 0, and the subsequent loop that performs the division also doesn't execute (since `i < _poolCnt` is false if `_poolCnt` is 0, or the condition `isGaugeAliveForPool` fails). Thus, the division operation is unreachable when `_totalVoteWeight` is zero. This is a mischaracterization of the code logic, not a real vulnerability."
