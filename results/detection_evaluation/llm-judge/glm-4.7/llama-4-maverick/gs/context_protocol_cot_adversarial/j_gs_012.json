This follows the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, preventing reentrancy from draining funds. The scenario requires a 'malicious plugin', which implies a trusted role compromise (the plugin is set by the admin/DAO), making this a theoretical concern rather than a concrete vulnerability in the provided contract logic."
