In Solidity, low-level calls (like `call`) return a boolean, but high-level calls (like `manager.withdraw(interestAmount)`) automatically revert if the called function reverts. Therefore, the 'failure' is inherently handled by the transaction reverting, which maintains state consistency. The model's suggestion to use a try-catch block is unnecessary for standard high-level interactions where a revert is the desired behavior on failure."
