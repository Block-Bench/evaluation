Furthermore, the `token` and `lockManager` addresses are set in the constructor as immutable variables from a trusted plugin context; they are not user-supplied parameters that can be manipulated by an attacker to point to malicious contracts. The finding mischaracterizes standard view calls as a vulnerability."
