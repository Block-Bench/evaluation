The attack scenario requires the attacker to control a position manager, which is a trusted role (admin-registered). Even if reentrancy occurred, the state is already updated, preventing double-spending of interest. The suggested fix (ReentrancyGuard) is unnecessary as the code is already safe via CEI."

The function is correctly protected by `onlyPositionManagerContract`, ensuring only registered managers can call it. The function's purpose is to receive ETH (e.g., principal or interest) returned by managers; the accounting for these funds happens in the calling functions (`_withdrawETHFromManager` updates `pendingPrincipal`, `_claimInterestFromManager` updates `pendingInterest`). Adding accounting logic here would be incorrect as the context (principal vs interest) is unknown.
