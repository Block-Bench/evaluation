While delegatecall can be risky, the specific claim that this allows reentrancy into `vote` to manipulate state is not supported by the code logic. The `vote` function updates state (tally) before the execution check, and the execution path requires specific permissions and success criteria. The finding mischaracterizes the standard delegatecall execution pattern as a reentrancy vulnerability without a concrete exploit scenario."
