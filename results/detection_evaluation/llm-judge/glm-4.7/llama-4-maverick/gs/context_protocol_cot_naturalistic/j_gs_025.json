However, the `withdraw` function follows the checks-effects-interactions pattern: it checks balances, performs state updates (via external calls to Aave which update token balances), and then makes the external call to `liquidityBuffer`. The ETH is transferred to `liquidityBuffer` *after* the WETH has been unwrapped and withdrawn from Aave. Since the contract holds no ETH before this point (the `receive` function restricts ETH sends to WETH only), and the state (aWETH balance) is updated by the Aave pool before the call, there is no reentrancy vector that allows double-spending or state manipulation. The finding is a mischaracterization of standard external call patterns as a vulnerability."
