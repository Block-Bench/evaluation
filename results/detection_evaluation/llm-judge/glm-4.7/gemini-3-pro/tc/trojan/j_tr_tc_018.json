The attack scenario is concrete, step-by-step, and results in loss of funds (draining fees via 100% fee rate). This is a distinct vulnerability from the ground truth's missing initialization guard in `init`, as it relies on the exposed toggle function rather than the absence of a guard in `init` itself."
