The model incorrectly asserts that this allows withdrawing more tokens than the vault holds. In the `withdraw` function, `amount = (shares * pool * price) / (totalShares * 1e18)`. If `shares` represents a fraction of the total equity, the output `amount` correctly represents that fraction of the total pool value. The model's claim that a price increase allows draining the pool is a misunderstanding of the math; the `pool` variable in the numerator is the actual token balance, which acts as the constraint.
