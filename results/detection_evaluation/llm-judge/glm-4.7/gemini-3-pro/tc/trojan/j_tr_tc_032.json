Ground truth describes manipulating the pool state to an extreme ratio (e.g., 2:1) to extract value via asymmetric rounding during deposit/withdrawal cycles. Finding 1 describes a 'free withdrawal' scenario where `shareBurned` becomes 0 due to a ratio > 1:1 (e.g., 200:100). This specific scenario (ratio > 1:1 causing zero share burn) is mathematically impossible in this code because `pseudoTotalPool` is only incremented by deposits and decremented by withdrawals, and shares are calculated proportionally. The ratio cannot exceed 1:1 in the direction required for this specific attack. Thus, the root cause and attack vector are incorrect."
