However, the location is only a partial match because the ground truth specifies the vulnerable functions as 'deposit, borrow, getAssetPrice' (implying the interaction across `LendingPool` and `PoolOracle`), while the finding only lists `PoolOracle.sol`. The vulnerability type 'Oracle Manipulation' is a semantic match for 'price_oracle_manipulation'. Since the root cause is correct and the type matches, but the location is incomplete (missing the critical `borrow` function where the manipulation is exploited), this qualifies as a PARTIAL_MATCH."
