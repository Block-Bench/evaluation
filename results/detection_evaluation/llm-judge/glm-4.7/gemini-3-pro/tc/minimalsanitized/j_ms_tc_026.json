The root causes are distinct: Ground Truth = manipulatable external input; Finding = incorrect internal formula (price should not be in the ratio). The finding provides a concrete attack scenario (ghost tokens via price < 1) and a valid fix (remove price from calculation). Since the root cause does not match the ground truth (it's a different issue), it cannot be a TARGET_MATCH or PARTIAL_MATCH. It qualifies as BONUS_VALID because the vulnerability exists, has a concrete exploit, and causes fund loss."
