However, the root cause described focuses on draining the `Route` contract's own balance or executing in the context of `Route`. The Ground Truth specifies the root cause as user-controlled calldata being executed without validation *in the route contract* to drain *user approvals* held by the `SocketGateway`. The finding's attack scenario (draining Route's balance) differs from the Ground Truth (draining victim approvals via Gateway), and the finding fails to link the arbitrary call to the `SocketGateway`'s approval context. Thus, the root cause does not match the specific TARGET vulnerability."
