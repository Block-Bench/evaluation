However, the `SimplifiedOracle` contract does not implement a `receive` or fallback function, nor does it interact with the Curve pool in a way that would trigger a callback during a `borrow` call. The `borrow` function calls `getPrice`, which is a `view` function. The scenario described requires the lending contract to be the recipient of a callback from Curve, which is architecturally impossible here. The actual vulnerability is flash loan price manipulation, not reentrancy."

However, the `borrow` function compares `maxBorrow` (calculated in collateral value terms) against `borrowed + amount` (borrow token terms). While the comparison is technically dimensionally inconsistent (comparing collateral-value-units to borrow-token-units), this is a design flaw or logic error, not a guaranteed exploit that allows draining the pool. The scenario assumes the contract holds 1.6 trillion USDC to transfer. Without massive liquidity, the transfer fails. This is a mischaracterization of a guaranteed critical exploit; it is at best a design flaw or low-severity logic issue."
