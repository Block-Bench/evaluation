However, the `mintPosition` function (lines 42-45) only increments a counter and returns an ID; it does not interact with an external NFT contract, nor does it track ownership of IDs. The `positionNFTs` interface is declared but never initialized or used. Consequently, `_nftId` functions merely as a user-provided index/key into the `userLendingShares` mapping. Since the shares are tracked by this key and the funds are transferred to `msg.sender`, a user cannot withdraw funds associated with a different key unless they possess the shares for that key. The 'vulnerability' relies on the existence of an ownership check that is not part of the contract's design. This is a mischaracterization of the code's logic, not a security vulnerability."
