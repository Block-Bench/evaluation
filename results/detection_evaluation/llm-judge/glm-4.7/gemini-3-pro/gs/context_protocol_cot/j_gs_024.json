However, `cumulativeDrawdown` tracks the amount of ETH that has left the buffer to fulfill unstake requests. This ETH is now held by the `unstakeRequestsManager`. The `totalControlled()` function adds `unstakeRequestsManager.balance()`. If `cumulativeDrawdown` were NOT subtracted, the ETH would be counted twice (once as a buffer liability/drawdown and once as manager balance). The current formula correctly accounts for the transfer of assets between internal protocol components. The 'net-zero change' argument in the finding ignores that the drawdown represents a reduction in the buffer's equity that is offset by an increase in the manager's balance, and the formula `ManagerBalance + BufferBalance - Drawdown` correctly captures the total assets without double counting. Therefore, this is not a vulnerability but correct accounting logic."
