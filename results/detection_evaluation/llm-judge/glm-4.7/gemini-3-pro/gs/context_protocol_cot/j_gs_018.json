However, the code calls `currentRequestId()` *before* `redeemRequest`. In standard counter-based implementations (like ERC721/ERC20 counters), `currentRequestId` typically returns the ID that *will be assigned* to the next request (N), and after `redeemRequest` is called, the counter increments to N+1. Therefore, fetching the ID *before* the call is the correct approach to capture the ID N associated with the request being created. The model's assumption that `currentRequestId` returns the *previous* ID is incorrect for standard patterns, and the described attack scenario (User B withdrawing User A's funds) is not possible because the `sender` check in `withdraw` verifies that the request belongs to the Gateway (which it does), but the `requestId` stored for User B would correctly point to their own request (N), not User A's (N-1). The finding relies on a misunderstanding of how request ID counters typically work."
