However, the code includes a check `if (shouldExecuteAllocation)` which is controlled by the admin (via `setShouldExecuteAllocation`). If the cap is reached, the admin can disable auto-allocation to prevent reverts, allowing deposits to remain in `pendingPrincipal`. This is an operational configuration issue, not a vulnerability.

However, `_claimInterestFromManager` follows the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern: it updates state *before* the external call. The `pendingInterest` variable represents the *accounted* interest available for top-up, not the physical ETH balance. The function `topUpInterestToStaking` checks `address(this).balance < amount` before transferring. If the manager returns less ETH than accounted, the contract's physical balance will be lower than the accounting suggests, but the `topUpInterestToStaking` check will prevent a transfer that would drain principal. The issue described would manifest as a failure to top up (DoS), not insolvency, and relies on the manager contract violating the expected interface behavior (returning less than requested)."
