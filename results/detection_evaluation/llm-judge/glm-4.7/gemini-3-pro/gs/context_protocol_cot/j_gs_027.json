However, `liquidityBuffer.getAvailableBalance()` typically returns the *current* balance of the buffer (which decreases when ETH is sent out), while `cumulativeDrawdown()` tracks the total amount withdrawn. The formula `Balance - Drawdown` is mathematically sound for calculating the *original* or *net* contribution of the buffer to the total assets, preventing the double-counting the model fears. The model's scenario (attacker stealing value by depositing after the rate drops) is based on a misunderstanding of how these variables interact; the rate would not drop as described because the subtraction of drawdown corrects the balance to reflect the buffer's net contribution, not its current holdings. Therefore, the identified issue does not exist as a vulnerability."
