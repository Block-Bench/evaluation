Therefore, calling `vote` after `poke` does not add to the previous votes but replaces them. The `onlyNewEpoch` modifier in `vote` checks if the current epoch is greater than the last voted epoch. Since `poke` does not update `lastVoted`, calling `vote` in the same epoch after `poke` would indeed pass the `onlyNewEpoch` check, but this is not a vulnerability because the votes are reset, not accumulated. The user is simply changing their vote, not casting two separate votes that sum up. The ground truth vulnerability is about a Denial of Service (DoS) caused by dust votes rounding to zero, preventing the `poke` function from executing at all. The model's finding describes a completely different mechanism (missing timestamp update) and impact (vote manipulation vs DoS), which is incorrect."
