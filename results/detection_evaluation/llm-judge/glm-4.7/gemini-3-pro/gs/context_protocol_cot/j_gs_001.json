However, the `deposit` function in this contract locks assets into a veNFT (`deposit_for`), which increases `totalAssets`. The `calculateShares` function uses `totalAssets` in the denominator. If an attacker donates assets, `totalAssets` increases, causing the share price to drop (deflationary for existing users), not inflate. The attacker would lose value by donating. The scenario where a victim receives 0 shares requires the attacker to have a massive share of the supply, which is not achieved by the described donation method (which doesn't mint shares).

The root cause is that `totalAssets()` only counts the HYBR locked in the veNFT, ignoring the floating balance in the contract. When `claimRewards()` is called, HYBR sits in the contract balance. If a user deposits before `compound()`, they get shares based on the lower `totalAssets`. When `compound()` executes, the floating balance is locked, increasing `totalAssets` and the share price. The attacker can then withdraw to capture the price difference. This is a real economic exploit not covered by the ground truth."
