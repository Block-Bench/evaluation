In standard EIP-4337 factory patterns (like Sequence), the constructor sets the implementation/module, and the 'imageHash' (salt) is used for address derivation, not constructor initialization. The finding assumes the existence of a separate `initialize` function that can be called by anyone to hijack the wallet, which is not present in the provided code and contradicts the deterministic deployment model where the configuration is derived from the salt. The actual vulnerability is a DoS when attempting to deploy an already existing address, not a front-running initialization issue."
