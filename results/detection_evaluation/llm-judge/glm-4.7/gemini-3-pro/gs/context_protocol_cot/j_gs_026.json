This amount is NOT represented in `liquidityBuffer.getAvailableBalance()` (which returns current capacity), nor is it in `unallocatedETH` (which holds current liquid assets). Therefore, subtracting it is necessary to accurately reflect the total assets controlled by the protocol. The scenario described (pulling ETH to satisfy unstakes) increases `unallocatedETH` and decreases `getAvailableBalance()`, but does NOT increase `cumulativeDrawdown()` (which only increases on permanent loss). The finding confuses temporary liquidity movement with permanent drawdowns."

However, `totalControlled()` calls `unstakeRequestsManager.balance()`, which returns the contract's ETH balance. The `UnstakeRequestsManager` is an external contract; there is no evidence in the provided code that it accepts direct ETH transfers or that `balance()` would return a value inflated by donations. Furthermore, the `Staking` contract has a `receive()` function that reverts, preventing direct ETH donations.
