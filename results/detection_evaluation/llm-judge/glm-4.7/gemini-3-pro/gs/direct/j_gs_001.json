However, the code does not allow arbitrary external donations to the veNFT. The `deposit_for` function in `IVotingEscrow` requires the caller to hold the tokens being deposited. While an attacker could theoretically deposit their own funds to skew the ratio, this would result in a financial loss for the attacker (they would be donating their own capital to dilute the pool value per share, not stealing from others). The finding claims the attacker can 'steal the victim's funds by withdrawing their single share which now claims the entire pool', but this ignores that the attacker's own large donation is part of that pool. This is a mischaracterization of a viable economic exploit; the described scenario is not a profitable attack vector."

While some voting escrow implementations might revert on zero amounts, this is a theoretical concern without concrete evidence that the specific `IVotingEscrow` implementation used here behaves this way. Furthermore, the finding ignores the `withdrawFee` mechanism: if a user withdraws, a fee is taken, meaning `remainingAmount` (calculated as `veBalance - userAmount - feeAmount`) will not be zero as long as the fee is non-zero. The protocol enforces a minimum fee of 0.1% (`MIN_WITHDRAW_FEE = 10`). Therefore, the condition `remainingAmount == 0` is practically impossible to reach in a valid withdrawal scenario. This is a theoretical concern without a concrete, profitable exploit path."
