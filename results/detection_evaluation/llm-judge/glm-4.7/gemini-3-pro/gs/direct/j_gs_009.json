The root cause is that `merge` transfers voting power from a source NFT to a destination NFT without updating the `ownership_change` mapping for the destination NFT. This bypasses the flash-vote protection mechanism implemented in `balanceOfNFT`. The attack scenario is concrete: an attacker can transfer a 'tainted' NFT (where `ownership_change` is set to the current block) and immediately merge it into a 'clean' NFT to vote in the same block. The suggested fix (updating `ownership_change[_to] = block.number` in `merge`) is valid and directly addresses the issue. This is a different vulnerability than the ground truth (which concerns `_checkpoint` logic and epoch timestamps), so it qualifies as BONUS_VALID."
