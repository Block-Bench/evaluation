The ground truth specifies the root cause is that when a chained signature is used with the checkpointer flag (bit 6) unset, the checkpointer validation block is skipped entirely, leaving `_checkpointer` and `snapshot` as zero/unused, which bypasses the intended checkpointer enforcement. The model's explanation focuses on the logic of the comparison operator (`<=`) and checkpoint values, whereas the ground truth focuses on the conditional execution of the checkpointer block based on the signature flag."
