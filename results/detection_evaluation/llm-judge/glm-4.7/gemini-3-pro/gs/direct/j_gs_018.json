However, the code shows `currentRequestId()` is called *before* `redeemRequest`. In standard counter patterns (like ERC721 Enumerable or similar vault implementations), `currentRequestId` typically returns the ID that *will be assigned* to the next request (i.e., the current counter value), not the previous one. If the counter is at N, `currentRequestId()` returns N, and `redeemRequest` uses N and increments to N+1. The model's assumption that `currentRequestId()` returns N-1 is incorrect. Furthermore, the model's attack scenario relies on User B stealing User A's funds via ID collision, which would only be possible if the model's incorrect assumption about the counter behavior were true. Since the described behavior (off-by-one ID mismatch) does not exist in the code based on standard implementation patterns and the visible logic, this is a hallucinated vulnerability."
