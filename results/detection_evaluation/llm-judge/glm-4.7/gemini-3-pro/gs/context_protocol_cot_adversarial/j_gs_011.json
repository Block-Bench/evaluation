In the provided code, `LockToVotePlugin.clearVote` does not make external calls back to the user or the LockManager. Furthermore, even if reentrancy were possible, the `unlock()` function checks `getLockedBalance(msg.sender)` at the start. If the balance is zeroed in the outer call, the inner call would revert with `NoBalance()`. If the balance is not zeroed, the inner call would attempt to clear votes again. The scenario described (draining funds) is not feasible with the current implementation and relies on a hypothetical, non-existent malicious plugin.
