Subtracting it from the current available balance prevents double-counting of those losses (once as a reduction in available balance, and implicitly again if not adjusted). The model's claim that this causes the protocol to 'lose' value during transfers is mathematically incorrect; the accounting correctly reflects that the buffer's current balance is net of prior drawdowns. The scenario described (diluting stakers by staking at a low rate) would not work because the rate calculation is consistent with the actual net assets of the protocol."
