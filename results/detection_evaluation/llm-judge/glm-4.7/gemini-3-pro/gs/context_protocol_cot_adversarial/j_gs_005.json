If the manager is updated to point a pool to a new bribe contract, `_reset` attempts to withdraw from the new contract where the user has no balance, causing a revert. This permanently locks the user's ability to vote, reset, or poke. The attack scenario is concrete, does not require compromising a trusted role (it relies on the admin exercising their legitimate `setGaugeManager` function, which is a standard protocol operation, not a compromise), and has a genuine impact (frozen voting power). This is a different vulnerability than the ground truth (which concerns dust votes in `poke`), so it qualifies as BONUS_VALID."
