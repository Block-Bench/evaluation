However, the provided code shows `_execute(abi.encodeCall(IMidasRedemptionVaultGateway.withdraw, (amount)))`, which implies the interface definition for `withdraw` in `IMidasRedemptionVaultGateway` accepts a single `uint256` argument. The model hallucinates a mismatch between the adapter's call and the gateway's expected interface without evidence from the provided code. While the model correctly identifies `withdrawPhantomToken` as a location of interest, the root cause (missing parameter in function call) contradicts the code implementation (which encodes the call exactly as defined by the interface). The ground truth identifies a different root cause: the adapter fails to verify that the phantom token's tracked output matches the actual pending redemption's output token, allowing a mismatch in state rather than a revert or signature error."
