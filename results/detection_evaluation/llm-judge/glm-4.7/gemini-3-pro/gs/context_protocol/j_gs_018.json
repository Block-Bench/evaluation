The model's scenario requires the Midas Vault to have a non-standard, buggy implementation where `currentRequestId` lags behind the actual counter, which is not supported by the provided code or standard patterns. The code correctly captures the ID before the request is made, which is the standard pattern for auto-incrementing IDs. The finding describes a theoretical issue based on an incorrect assumption about the external contract's behavior, rather than a vulnerability in the provided code."
