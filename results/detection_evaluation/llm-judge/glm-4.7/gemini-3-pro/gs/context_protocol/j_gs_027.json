However, this is incorrect accounting logic. `cumulativeDrawdown` tracks the total amount ever withdrawn from the buffer. `getAvailableBalance()` returns the current balance. The formula `unallocatedETH + getAvailableBalance() - cumulativeDrawdown` correctly calculates the net contribution of the buffer to the protocol's total assets (Current Balance - Total Withdrawals = Net Contribution). When funds move, `unallocatedETH` increases by X, `getAvailableBalance` decreases by X, and `cumulativeDrawdown` increases by X. The net change is +X - X - X = -X for the buffer terms, but +X for `unallocatedETH`, resulting in a net change of 0. The value is correctly preserved, just shifted between buckets. The finding misinterprets the accounting mechanics."
