The `deposit_for` function in standard VotingEscrow implementations (like Curve's) requires the caller to be the owner of the NFT or approved. Since `GrowthHYBR` is the owner of `veTokenId`, it can call `deposit_for`. An external attacker cannot call `deposit_for` for `veTokenId` because they do not own it and are not approved. The attacker would need to call `create_lock` to create their own veNFT, which does not affect the `totalAssets()` of `GrowthHYBR`'s `veTokenId`. Therefore, the attack vector described is technically impossible."
