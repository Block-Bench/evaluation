However, this is a mischaracterization of the protocol's accounting mechanics. When `receiveReturnsFromLiquidityBuffer` is called, `unallocatedETH` increases. The `totalControlled()` function sums `unallocatedETH` and `liquidityBuffer.getAvailableBalance()`. If `getAvailableBalance()` decreases by the transferred amount, the sum remains constant. The subtraction of `cumulativeDrawdown()` is likely intended to track the portion of the buffer's balance that is already accounted for in `unallocatedETH` or other variables to prevent double-counting, or to represent net liquidity. The scenario described (funds vanishing) assumes `cumulativeDrawdown` increases *in addition* to the balance decrease, which would imply a bug in the buffer contract, not necessarily in this formula. Without evidence that `cumulativeDrawdown` is added to the balance elsewhere or that the buffer balance doesn't decrease, the claim that this causes a loss of value in `totalControlled` is incorrect. The finding fails to prove that the accounting is actually wrong versus just complex."
