However, this is a standard architectural pattern (factory pattern) where pools are expected to query the factory for current state or the factory manages the reference. The provided code shows `CLFactory` holds the authoritative `gaugeManager` state. If `CLPool` needs the current manager, it should query the factory. The finding assumes a specific implementation detail in `CLPool` (that it stores the address permanently and uses it exclusively) which is not visible in the provided code.
