However, the `IMidasRedemptionVaultGateway.withdraw(uint256 amount)` interface (implied by the code) is designed to withdraw the user's pending redemption(s). The finding incorrectly assumes the Gateway requires a token selector to function correctly or that it defaults arbitrarily. The actual vulnerability is that `withdrawPhantomToken` doesn't verify the phantom token's underlying matches the actual redemption output, not that the withdrawal call itself is ambiguous."

This is a mischaracterization of the protocol's design. The `_convertToE18` function normalizes amounts to a common 18-decimal precision for internal calculations or Gateway requirements. If the Gateway expects 18-decimal precision for the `minReceiveAmount` parameter (as implied by the adapter's logic), this is correct behavior, not a vulnerability. The finding treats a design choice (normalization) as a bug without evidence that the Gateway expects native decimals."
