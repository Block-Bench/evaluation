However, the ground truth context specifies this is a Lock-to-Vote system where `currentTokenSupply()` returns `IERC20(lockManager.token()).totalSupply()`. In a standard ERC20 implementation, `totalSupply()` is a state variable that decreases when tokens are burned. While the finding correctly identifies that the supply is dynamic, it mischaracterizes the exploitability. In a Lock-to-Vote system, the quorum is based on the total token supply, not the locked supply. If tokens are burned, the total supply decreases, but the locked tokens (which represent the votes cast) also decrease proportionally if the burned tokens were locked, or remain constant if they were not. The finding assumes that burning tokens reduces the denominator (total supply) without affecting the numerator (votes cast), which is not necessarily true or exploitable in the way described to force a failing proposal to pass. Furthermore, the ground truth identifies a specific vulnerability in `createProposal` regarding action validation and delegatecall, which this finding does not address. This appears to be a mischaracterization of standard governance mechanics rather than a concrete vulnerability."
