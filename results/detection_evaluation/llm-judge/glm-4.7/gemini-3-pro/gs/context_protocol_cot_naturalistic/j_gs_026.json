However, `unstakeRequestsManager` is an external interface (`IUnstakeRequestsManager`). The code does not show that this contract accepts direct ETH transfers or that such transfers would be counted in `unstakeRequestsManager.balance()` (which likely tracks internal accounting of requests, not `address(this).balance`). Furthermore, the `stake` function uses `Math.mulDiv` which handles large numbers safely, and the scenario relies on a specific implementation of the external contract that isn't provided or proven vulnerable. This appears to be a mischaracterization of standard liquidity pool mechanics or a hallucination of external contract behavior."

Preventing the revert by capping `total` at 0 would hide this corruption and allow the protocol to continue operating with incorrect, potentially malicious state.
