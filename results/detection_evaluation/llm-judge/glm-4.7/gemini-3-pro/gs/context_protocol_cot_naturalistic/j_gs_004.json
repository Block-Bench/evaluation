However, the `multiSplit` function in standard VotingEscrow implementations (like Curve's) typically allows splitting with 0 amounts (effectively burning the NFT or creating an empty one). The code handles the `remainingAmount` calculation correctly (`veBalance - userAmount - feeAmount`), and if the protocol is empty, `remainingAmount` being 0 is the correct state to pass to the split function.
