Finding 0 discusses 'WalletLibrary.initWallet' but in the context of the Wallet proxy, not the library itself. Finding 1 discusses 'WalletLibrary.kill'. Neither finding aligns with a generic 'access control' label for 'initWallet' without further specification, and the model's specific root causes (re-initialization, uninitialized library) do not match a generic 'missing authorization' description. Therefore, no TARGET_MATCH is possible. Both findings are classified as BONUS_VALID as they represent real, critical vulnerabilities with concrete exploit paths.",
