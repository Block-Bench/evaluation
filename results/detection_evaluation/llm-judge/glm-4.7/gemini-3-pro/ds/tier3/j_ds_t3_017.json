This creates a honeypot scenario where user funds are trapped. However, the ground truth specifies the TARGET vulnerability is in the `withdraw` function. Since the location (`multiplicate`) does not match the ground truth location (`withdraw`), this cannot be a TARGET_MATCH or PARTIAL_MATCH. It is classified as BONUS_VALID because it is a genuine, exploitable vulnerability not covered by the ground truth."
