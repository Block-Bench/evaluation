The finding claims funds are 'permanently locked' because `suicide()` checks `Destructible.owner` (slot 0, initialized to address(0)) against `msg.sender`. In reality, `address(0)` is a valid address that can be passed as `msg.sender` via `CREATE2` or by finding a vanity address. Therefore, the `require(owner == msg.sender)` check can be satisfied, allowing the contract to be destroyed and funds drained. The vulnerability is unauthorized destruction (access control bypass), not locked funds. Since the claimed impact (locked funds) is impossible and the actual impact (unauthorized destruction) is the opposite of what is described, this is a mischaracterization of the vulnerability's exploitability and impact."
