Since `this.balance` is read fresh each time, the second transfer sends the remaining balance (likely 0). Reentrancy would require the attacker to send `msg.value` again on re-entry, which costs funds. The described attack (draining multiple times) is impossible because the balance is depleted after the first transfer. This is a logic error (sending balance twice), not reentrancy."
