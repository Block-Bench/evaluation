The resulting lock becomes permanent, which is the intended behavior of merging into a permanent lock. The finding claims this bypasses `lockPermanent()` restrictions, but `lockPermanent` is for converting an existing lock to permanent, whereas `merge` is a separate operation that combines two locks. The logic correctly prevents merging a permanent lock into a temporary one (which would lose permanence), while allowing merging a temporary lock into a permanent one (which preserves permanence). This is a design choice, not a vulnerability."
