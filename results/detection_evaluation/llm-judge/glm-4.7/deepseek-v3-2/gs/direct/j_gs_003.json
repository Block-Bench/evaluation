However, the logic `rewardRate = (reward + leftover) / DURATION` is standard for staking gauges (like Synthetix/Convex) to maintain a constant emission rate over a fixed duration (1 week). The `leftover` represents the total amount remaining to be distributed, and adding the new `reward` and re-dividing by `DURATION` correctly smooths the rate over the next full period. The model's suggested fix `rewardRate = (reward + leftover) / remaining` would drastically change the emission schedule (front-loading rewards) and is not a vulnerability in the intended design."

This is an intentional design pattern in gauge systems where a distributor (GaugeManager) aggregates claims to save gas for users.

While a compromised distributor is a risk, it is a centralization/design choice, not a vulnerability in the contract logic itself. The model's scenario relies on the trusted role being compromised, which is out of scope for contract-level logic errors unless the role assignment itself is flawed."
