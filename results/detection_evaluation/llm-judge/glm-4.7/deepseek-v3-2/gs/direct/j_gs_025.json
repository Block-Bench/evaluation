This is a mischaracterization because the function executes atomically. External contracts (old or new buffer) cannot execute code *during* the execution of setLiquidityBuffer. The state change is atomic; the role is revoked and granted in the same transaction context, so no external call can intervene between the two role management operations. Furthermore, even if both had the role simultaneously, the withdraw function checks the contract's own aWETH balance, which cannot be double-spent or drained by two callers in a way that exceeds the actual balance.
