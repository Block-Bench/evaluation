Since `votingPower` is 0 after clearing, any new vote with `_newVotingPower > 0` will pass this check. The subsequent check `if (_newVotingPower == _currentVotingPower && _voteOption == proposal_.votes[_voter].voteOption)` will also pass because `_newVotingPower` (new balance) != `_currentVotingPower` (0).
