      "reasoning": "The finding claims that the `onlyNewEpoch` modifier prevents voting in the epoch immediately after a vote because `lastVoted` is set to `epochStart(block.timestamp) + 1`. However, the modifier condition `if (HybraTimeLibrary.epochStart(block.timestamp) <= lastVoted[_tokenId])` correctly allows voting in epoch N+1 when `lastVoted` is set to the start of epoch N+1 (since `start(N+1) <= start(N+1)` is true, but the check is `<=`, so it would revert if `lastVoted` was set to `start(N+1)`). Wait, let's re-evaluate the logic. If `lastVoted` is set to `epochStart(block.timestamp) + 1` (which is the start of the NEXT epoch), then in the current epoch, `epochStart(block.timestamp)` is the start of the current epoch. The check `current_start <= next_epoch_start` is true, so it reverts. In the next epoch, `epochStart` returns the start of the next epoch. The check `next_epoch_start <= next_epoch_start` is true, so it reverts. This means the user must wait until the epoch AFTER the next one (epoch N+2) to vote. This is indeed a bug (waiting 2 epochs instead of 1). However, the Ground Truth target is about the `poke` function and a DoS caused by dust votes rounding to zero. This finding is about a different function (`vote`/`onlyNewEpoch`) and a different root cause (epoch timing logic vs rounding error). While this finding identifies a real logic error, it is not the TARGET vulnerability. Is it a BONUS_VALID? The finding claims the mechanism is 'broken', preventing vote updates. If users can only vote every 2 epochs instead of 1, this is a functional bug but not necessarily a security vulnerability with 'loss of funds' or 'critical state manipulation' in the context of an attack. It restricts functionality. The prompt asks for BONUS_VALID if there is a 'CONCRETE, SPECIFIC attack scenario with step-by-step exploit' and 'loss of funds, unauthorized access, or critical state manipulation'. This finding describes a functional limitation (users can't vote as often as intended) rather than an exploit. Therefore, it is best classified as MISCHARACTERIZED (it's a bug, but not a security vulnerability) or INFORMATIONAL. Given the severity 'high' claimed, it is a mischaracterization of the security impact."
