However, the code at line 231 calls `_attemptEarlyExecution(_proposalId, _msgSender())`. In the context of the `vote` function, `_msgSender()` is indeed the LockManager (due to the `auth` modifier and the call flow). The finding suggests passing `_voter` instead. While this is a design consideration (who should trigger execution?), the current behavior is not a vulnerability because the LockManager is a trusted, permissioned component (it requires `LOCK_MANAGER_PERMISSION_ID` to call `vote`). If the LockManager is malicious or compromised, the system is already broken. The finding mischaracterizes standard trusted component interaction as an access control bypass. Furthermore, the ground truth vulnerability is about `currentTokenSupply` manipulation, which is completely unrelated to this finding."
