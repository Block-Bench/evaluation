This is mathematically correct behavior for the provided weights (0.1%), not a vulnerability. The user requested a split where one part is 0.1% of the total, and received 0 tokens due to integer precision limits of the underlying token (assumed 18 decimals, 100 tokens is 1e20, 0.1% is 1e17, which is > 0). Even with 1 token (1e18), 0.1% is 1e15 (> 0). The scenario [1, 999] on 100 tokens results in 0.1 and 99.9 tokens. 0.1 tokens is 1e17, which is non-zero. The finding hallucinates a precision loss that doesn't exist for reasonable token amounts, or mischaracterizes user error (splitting dust amounts) as a vulnerability. The code correctly enforces `amounts[i] > 0`."
