However, the code in `LockToVotePlugin.vote` (lines 157-160) calls `_canVote` before processing the vote. The `_canVote` function (lines 267-271) explicitly checks `if (_newVotingPower == 0 || _newVotingPower < _currentVotingPower) { return false; }`. This prevents a voter from changing their vote to a lower power. Therefore, the scenario where a voter with 100 power drops to 50 and changes their vote is impossible because the transaction would revert. The finding describes a vulnerability that does not exist in the code."
