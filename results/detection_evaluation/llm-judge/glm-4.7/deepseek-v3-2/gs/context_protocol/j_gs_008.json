If the position is voted, the function reverts with 'Cannot withdraw yet' before attempting `multiSplit`. This is an intended access control restriction (withdrawal windows), not a vulnerability. The protocol is designed to prevent withdrawals during active voting periods. The finding misinterprets a design constraint as a DoS vulnerability."
