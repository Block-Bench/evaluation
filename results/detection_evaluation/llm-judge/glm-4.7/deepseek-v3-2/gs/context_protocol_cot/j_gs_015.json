However, the code correctly checks `dao().hasPermission(address(this), _voteCaller, EXECUTE_PROPOSAL_PERMISSION_ID, _msgData())`. The `_voteCaller` is the `msg.sender` of the `vote` transaction (the LockManager), and the check verifies if this caller has permission to execute proposals on behalf of the plugin. Since the LockManager is a trusted component authorized to call `vote`, and early execution is a consequence of voting, this check is appropriate. The finding's claim that `_msgData()` containing vote data instead of execute data causes a bypass is incorrect; the permission check validates the caller's authority, not the calldata format. Furthermore, the scenario requires a misconfigured DAO ('wildcard permissions') to exploit, which is not a vulnerability in this contract. The finding does not match the ground truth vulnerability regarding missing action target validation in `createProposal`."
