However, `clearVote` is called on the `plugin` contract, which is an external interface. The `proposalEnded` function in `LockManagerBase` (which modifies `knownProposalIds`) has an access control check `if (msg.sender != address(plugin)) revert InvalidPluginAddress()`. For the attack scenario to work, the plugin would need to call back into `LockManagerBase.proposalEnded` from within `clearVote`. While technically possible if the plugin is malicious, this requires the trusted plugin component to be compromised or maliciously designed, which is outside the standard threat model for a reentrancy finding (which typically assumes untrusted external callers). Furthermore, the iteration logic in `_withdrawActiveVotingPower` correctly handles removals by adjusting `_proposalCount` and using `continue`, preventing index out-of-bounds or skipping issues under normal operation. The finding mischaracterizes the behavior of the loop and relies on a compromised trusted component to create an exploit scenario."
