The contract's design is to compound rewards into the veNFT via `compound()`. Until `compound()` is called, the HYBR balance is indeed separate from the vault's principal (the veNFT). Depositors receiving shares based on the veNFT balance is correct accounting for a vault where the principal is the veNFT. Once rewards are compounded, they become part of `totalAssets()`. This is a design characteristic, not a vulnerability. The scenario described (depositing before compounding) does not allow stealing funds; it simply means the new shares don't capture the yet-uncompounded rewards, which is fair."

While the finding suggests this might be too restrictive (DoS), it is not a vulnerability that allows fund loss or unauthorized access. It is a design choice to enforce stricter withdrawal conditions, possibly to ensure voting power is maintained until reset.
