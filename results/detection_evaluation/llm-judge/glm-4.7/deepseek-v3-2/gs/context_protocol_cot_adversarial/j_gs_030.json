The code uses LibBytes/LibOptim which typically handle bounds checking or revert safely. The scenario of 'bypassing validation' via out-of-bounds reads returning zero values is speculative and not a concrete exploit path in this context.

In Solidity, writing to a memory array index beyond its initial length is valid as long as it is within the allocated memory chunk (which is determined by the initial `new` call).
