However, `isGranted()` is a `view` function called during permission checks (e.g., by `createProposal`), which is a separate transaction from `unlock()`. Solidity's transaction atomicity prevents the state change in `unlock()` from affecting a read in `isGranted()` in a different transaction. The scenario described requires `isGranted()` to be called *during* the execution of `unlock()` (e.g., via a reentrant call), but `unlock()` performs no external calls to `MinVotingPowerCondition` or `createProposal` that would trigger this. The finding describes a theoretical state inconsistency that cannot occur in practice under standard EVM execution semantics."
