However, the attack scenario described (USDT non-compliance causing reverts) is factually incorrect for the code provided. The code uses `IERC20` which defines `transfer` as returning a boolean. Calling a non-compliant USDT (which returns void) via the IERC20 interface would result in a decoding error/revert, not a silent failure. The ground truth specifically concerns tokens that return `false` without reverting (like BAT, ZRX) allowing balance inflation in `_doLockTransfer`. Finding 0 focuses on `_doUnlockTransfer` and describes a different failure mode (locking funds due to reverts) rather than the ground truth's inflation attack."
