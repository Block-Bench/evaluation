The logic correctly enforces the limit; a malicious quoter signing a quote with `maxAmountIn=0` simply creates a quote that accepts 0 input, which is valid but useless, not a vulnerability."

The `quoteSigner` is the single source of truth for nonce management. If User A uses nonce 5, it is because the signer issued it to them. User B would never be issued nonce 5 by the same signer.
