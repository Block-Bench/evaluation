However, the ground truth clarifies that the function `_incomingTokenBalance` is specifically designed to lock the user's *approved* balance (allowance), not their total balance. The vulnerability is not that it checks allowance, but that it fails to handle the `type(uint256).max` (unlimited) allowance case correctly. The model's proposed fix (using `balanceOf`) would break the intended functionality of locking approved tokens."

The parent contract `LockManagerBase` likely follows checks-effects-interactions (updating state before calling `_doUnlockTransfer`).
