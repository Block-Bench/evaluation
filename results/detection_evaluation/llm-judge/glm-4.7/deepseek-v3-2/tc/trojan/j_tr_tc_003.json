In a delegatecall context, the proxy's storage is used, but the finding's specific claim about overwriting `libraryAddress` via `initWallet` is technically incorrect because `libraryAddress` is in the proxy and `initWallet` writes to the proxy's storage slots (which are empty initially). While storage layout is a concern in proxy patterns, the specific attack vector described (overwriting the library address pointer to redirect execution) is not how this code functions. The proxy's `libraryAddress` is immutable in the sense that it is a state variable in the proxy, not the library."
