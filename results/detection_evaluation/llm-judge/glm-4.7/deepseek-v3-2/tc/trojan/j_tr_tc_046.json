This allows a compromised or malicious pending admin to execute critical functions like `setLockRecipient` and `emergencyUnlock` before officially assuming the role. The attack scenario is concrete and results in fund theft. While the ground truth focuses on the lack of multi-sig for the *current* admin, this finding highlights a logic flaw in the admin transfer mechanism itself, which is a distinct, valid vulnerability."

However, `playerBalances` is only used to track the total amount locked by a user. The `lock` function sets `lockedAmount` to the *current* lock amount (overwriting previous), and `playerBalances` accumulates the total. When `unlock` is called, it clears the current lock state. Since `lock` overwrites `lockedAmount` rather than adding to it, `playerBalances` acts as a cumulative counter (lifetime deposits), not a live balance available for withdrawal. Resetting it to zero on unlock is arguably incorrect for a 'lifetime' counter, but it does not enable the claimed exploit of 'losing track of the second 100 tokens' because the second lock would have overwritten `lockedAmount` to 100, and the unlock would release 100. The accounting is messy but not exploitable to steal funds or double-spend as described."
