If the token is malicious and returns true without transferring, the user's balance decreases while the contract's balance does not increase, but the contract's internal accounting (`_0x65ce0c`) increases. This is a valid accounting discrepancy, but the scenario requires the attacker to control the token address (`_0x7248ad`), which is set in the constructor and immutable. The attack scenario 'sets _0x7248ad to point to this malicious token' is impossible as there is no setter. Thus, the specific attack described is not feasible in the provided code."
