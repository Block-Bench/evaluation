This is a mischaracterization of the code logic. Line 32 checks `_0x347a3f[_0xd6cb4d][msg.sender] >= _0x65ce0c` and Line 35 subtracts from `_0x347a3f[_0xd6cb4d][msg.sender]`. The function only allows a user to withdraw from their own balance (msg.sender's balance). The parameter `_0xd6cb4d` is the token address, not the victim's address. Therefore, the attack scenario described (stealing from other users) is impossible based on the code provided."
