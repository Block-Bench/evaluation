The claim that 'actual token balances remain 1000+1000 due to withdrawal calculations being independent of actual token transfers' ignores that this is a state-managing contract where internal variables (_0xd80623, _0x7d6277) represent the balances. The arithmetic is consistent with the share ownership; there is no rounding error exploit demonstrated in the scenario provided."
