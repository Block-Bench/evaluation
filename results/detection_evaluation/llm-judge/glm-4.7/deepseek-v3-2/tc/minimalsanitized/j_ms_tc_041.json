The finding claims this allows an attacker to 'break reward claims' or 'drain funds', but a revert in the external call would simply revert the entire transaction, preventing state manipulation or fund drainage.

If the rewards belong to the user's position within the SmartLoan, passing `msg.sender` is the correct logic to ensure the user receives the tokens.
