While `settings.lockedAmount` is overwritten, `playerBalances` accumulates correctly (line 57). When `unlock()` is called, it transfers the full accumulated balance. The scenario described (losing 100 WETH) is impossible because the contract tracks the total balance separately from the current lock settings. This is a misunderstanding of the code logic, not a real vulnerability."
