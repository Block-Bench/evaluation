The attack scenario is concrete: an attacker can add a malicious token with a high collateral factor, mint it (since `mint` only checks if the market is supported, not if the transfer succeeded), and use it as collateral to borrow real assets. This results in a loss of funds. This is a different vulnerability than the TARGET (price oracle manipulation), so it qualifies as BONUS_VALID."
