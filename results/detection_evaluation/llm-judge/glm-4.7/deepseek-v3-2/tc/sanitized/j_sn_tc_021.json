However, the location is identified as `getCollateralValue` instead of the ground truth function `borrow`. While `getCollateralValue` contains the vulnerable logic, the ground truth specifies `borrow` as the vulnerable function. The vulnerability type 'Price Manipulation Attack' is a semantic match for 'price_oracle_manipulation'.
