However, the contract uses a simple counter (`nftIdCounter`) to mint IDs and does not implement an actual ERC721 contract or ownership tracking. The `userLendingShares` mapping is the sole record of share ownership, keyed by `_nftId`. Since the contract does not track who 'owns' an NFT ID (no `ownerOf` implementation exists in the provided code), the caller of `withdrawExactShares` with a specific `_nftId` is implicitly the owner of those shares by virtue of holding the ID. The 'vulnerability' is actually a design choice (or an incomplete implementation) where the NFT is just a numeric identifier, not a transferable asset with enforced ownership. Therefore, this is not a security vulnerability but a mischaracterization of the code's architecture."
