Standard reentrancy attacks require the attacker to send value *back* to the victim contract to manipulate state before it updates. Here, the attacker receives tokens and would need to send them back, but the K invariant check (lines 93-96) and input amount calculation (lines 77-82) happen after the transfer and before state updates. Even if the attacker re-enters, the balances reflect the tokens already sent out, and the K check would fail if they tried to extract more value without providing sufficient input. This is a mischaracterization of the checks-effects-interactions pattern in the context of an AMM swap."
