The ground truth specifies a cross-function reentrancy where the attacker calls exitMarket during the callback to modify the inMarket state, bypassing the final health check. The model's attack scenario (re-entering borrow) would not work because borrowed[msg.sender] is updated before the external call, so the second call would fail the initial health check."
