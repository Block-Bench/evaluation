This allows an attacker to set the root to any value and then process arbitrary messages. While related to the same state variable as the ground truth, the root cause is 'Missing Access Control' on a setter function, whereas the ground truth root cause is 'Improper Initialization' (specifically the zero-root bypass after an upgrade)."
