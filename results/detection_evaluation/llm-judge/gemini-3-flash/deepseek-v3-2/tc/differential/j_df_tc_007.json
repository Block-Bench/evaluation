In Uniswap V3-style AMMs, `liquidityNet` represents the change in liquidity when crossing a tick from left to right. When swapping `zeroForOne` (price decreasing), the contract crosses ticks from right to left, meaning it should subtract `liquidityNet`. However, the code at line 133 inverts the value and then passes it to `_addLiquidity`. If `liquidityNet` was -100 (upper tick), it becomes +100, and `_addLiquidity` adds it, which is mathematically incorrect for that direction.
