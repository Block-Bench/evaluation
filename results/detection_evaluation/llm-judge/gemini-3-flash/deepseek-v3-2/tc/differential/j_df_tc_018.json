Because the pool balance was already reduced by the full `toAmount`, the fee is effectively taken from the pool's remaining reserves rather than being 'left behind' in the pool or accounted for separately. This leads to a discrepancy between `IERC20.balanceOf(address(this))` and the internal `baseBalance`/`quoteBalance` tracking, which can be exploited or lead to insolvency for LPs."
