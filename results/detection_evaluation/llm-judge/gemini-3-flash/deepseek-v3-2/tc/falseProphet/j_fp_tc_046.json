More importantly, because `playerBalances` is additive but `playerSettings.lockedAmount` is overwriting, a user calling `lock` twice will lose access to their first deposit's value during `unlock()`, as `unlock()` only transfers `settings.lockedAmount` (the second deposit) but clears the entire balance.
