In Solidity, calling a public mapping with a getter only returns the element at a specific index (if multiple keys) or fails if the signature doesn't match. Here, the model treats it as a function returning the whole array, which will cause a revert because the compiler-generated getter for a mapping requires the index as an additional argument.
