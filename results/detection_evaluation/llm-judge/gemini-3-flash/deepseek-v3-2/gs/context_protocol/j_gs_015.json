The `LockManager` is responsible for tracking locked balances and triggering updates. If a user's balance decreases, the `LockManager` would call `vote` with the new power. The logic in `vote` correctly subtracts the previously recorded `proposal_.votes[_voter].votingPower` (the 100 in the example) and adds the `_newVotingPower` (the 50). This is the intended behavior to keep the tally synchronized with current locked balances, not a vulnerability."
