When `increaseLiquidity` is called, new liquidity is minted to the contract and then deposited into the gauge if `staked` is true. Incrementing `_lp` by the new `liquidity` is correct because the total amount of LP tokens managed by the locker has indeed increased. The attack scenario's claim that `gauge.withdraw(lp())` would fail is incorrect because `lp()` (which returns `_lp`) would correctly represent the sum of the initial deposit and the new liquidity, which matches the total amount deposited into the gauge."
