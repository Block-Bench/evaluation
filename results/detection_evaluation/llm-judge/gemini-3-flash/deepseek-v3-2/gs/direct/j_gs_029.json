However, selfExecute has the 'onlySelf' modifier, meaning it can only be called by the contract itself. While a delegatecall executes in the context of the contract, the 'nonReentrant' modifier on the entry point 'execute' sets the reentrancy guard lock. Since selfExecute is called within the same transaction flow initiated by execute, even if it had the nonReentrant modifier, it would revert upon a recursive call. More importantly, the finding fails to identify a concrete state-changing exploit that bypasses the existing guard on the main entry point."
