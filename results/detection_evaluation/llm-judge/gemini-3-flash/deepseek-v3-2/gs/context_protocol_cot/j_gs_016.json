However, the model argues that the calculation is flawed because it counts liquid tokens that aren't committed to governance. While it misinterprets 'double-counting' (usually tokens in the manager are NOT in the user's wallet), it correctly identifies that counting `balanceOf` allows users to pass checks with liquid tokens that could be moved immediately after proposal creation, which is a common governance security concern. However, it does NOT match the ground truth root cause regarding blacklisted/frozen tokens."
