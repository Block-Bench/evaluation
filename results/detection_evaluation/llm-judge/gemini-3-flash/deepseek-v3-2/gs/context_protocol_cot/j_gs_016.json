This is technically incorrect in the context of standard ERC20 behavior: when a user locks tokens into the LockManager (a separate contract), the tokens are transferred from the user to the LockManager. Therefore, the user's `token.balanceOf(_who)` decreases by the locked amount, and `lockManager.getLockedBalance(_who)` increases. There is no double-counting. The ground truth vulnerability is about the inclusion of 'un-locked' wallet balances which might be non-transferable (blacklisted), whereas this finding focuses on a non-existent double-counting math error."
