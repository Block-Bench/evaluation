The `LockManager` is responsible for tracking locked balances and ensuring that a user's voting power is consistent with their locked state. Furthermore, the ground truth vulnerability is about the manipulation of `totalSupply` via flash loans/mints affecting thresholds, whereas this finding describes a state inconsistency between the plugin and the manager that is not substantiated by the provided code logic (as `_newVotingPower` is passed from the manager)."
