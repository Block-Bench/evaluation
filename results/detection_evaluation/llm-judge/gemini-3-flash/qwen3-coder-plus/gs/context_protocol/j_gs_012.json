However, in the provided code, the `_vote` function (called by `lockAndVote` or `vote`) passes the *current* total locked balance to the plugin. If a user locks more tokens and votes again, the plugin's `vote` function (as per standard Aragon patterns) typically updates the vote to the new power. The finding does not demonstrate a concrete exploit where voting power is 'doubled' (e.g., 100 + 150 = 250 power); it simply describes the intended behavior of increasing one's stake. Furthermore, it completely misses the target vulnerability regarding unchecked ERC20 return values."
