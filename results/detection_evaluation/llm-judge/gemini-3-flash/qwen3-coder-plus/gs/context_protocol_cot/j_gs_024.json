However, the exchange rate is derived from `totalControlled() / mETH.totalSupply()`. When a user stakes, `totalControlled` increases by `msg.value` and `mETH.totalSupply()` increases by the minted amount. When they unstake, `mETH` is transferred to the manager (not burned immediately) and `totalControlled` remains the same because it includes the manager's balance. The ratio remains consistent; there is no 'inflation' of the exchange rate through this circular path."
