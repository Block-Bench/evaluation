When a user stakes, `unallocatedETH` increases and `mETH.totalSupply()` increases proportionally. When they unstake, `unallocatedETH` stays the same (until allocation) but the funds move to `unstakeRequestsManager.balance()`, and `mETH` is transferred to the manager. Since `totalControlled()` includes both `unallocatedETH` and `unstakeRequestsManager.balance()`, the numerator and denominator in the exchange rate calculation scale together. There is no immediate 'inflation' profit from a single-transaction stake/unstake cycle as described."
