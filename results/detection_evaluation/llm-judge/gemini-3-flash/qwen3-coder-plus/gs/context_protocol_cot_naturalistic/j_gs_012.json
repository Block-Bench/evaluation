The code attempts to handle this with a `continue` and `_proposalCount` update, but the logic is flawed because `knownProposalIds.length()` changes, and the loop condition/index management in conjunction with `EnumerableSet`'s swap-and-pop behavior is prone to errors or skipping if not perfectly implemented. However, looking closely at the code's `continue` logic, it actually tries to mitigate the skip, but it's a high-risk pattern often leading to issues."
