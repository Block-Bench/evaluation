This makes `isHealthy` return `false` on line 51, but the `borrow` function's final check on line 71 would then fail, reverting the transaction. Wait, actually, if `inMarket` is false, `isHealthy` returns `false`, which would cause the `require` on line 71 to revert. The ground truth suggests the attacker bypasses collateral requirements; this would only work if the attacker can successfully call `exitMarket` and have the transaction complete. Since line 71 checks health again, the auditor and the ground truth have a slight discrepancy in how the exploit resolves, but the auditor completely missed the cross-function aspect.",
