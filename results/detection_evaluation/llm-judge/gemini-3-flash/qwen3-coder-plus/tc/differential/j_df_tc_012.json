If a user accidentally sends a non-underlying token to the contract, or if the contract accumulates other tokens (e.g., airdrops), any attacker can call sweepToken to steal them. In standard DeFi protocols (like Compound, which this contract mimics), sweep functions are strictly restricted to administrative roles."
