Furthermore, the `borrow` function uses `previewer.previewMultipleMarkets`, which calculates debt based on the `IMarket` snapshots. Even if reentrancy occurred, the `borrows` mapping is updated in the `LendingMarket` contract, but the `previewer` calls `getAccountSnapshot` on the market addresses provided in the array. The finding fails to identify that the real vulnerability is the ability to pass arbitrary, malicious market addresses to the previewer."
