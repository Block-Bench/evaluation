In a Lock-to-Vote system, if a user's locked balance decreases (e.g., due to a slash or a permitted partial withdrawal), the LockManager would call `vote` to sync the power. Because the plugin reverts on power decrease, it would indeed cause a DoS on the LockManager's withdrawal/unlock logic or result in 'Over-Voting' where a user keeps power they no longer have tokens for. This is a valid architectural flaw in the voting logic."
