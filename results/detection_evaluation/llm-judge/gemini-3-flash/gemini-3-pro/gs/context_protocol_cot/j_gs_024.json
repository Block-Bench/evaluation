The formula `total += liquidityBuffer.getAvailableBalance() - liquidityBuffer.cumulativeDrawdown()` is likely double-counting the reduction of assets. If `getAvailableBalance()` already reflects the current balance (assets minus transfers out), then subtracting `cumulativeDrawdown` (the sum of all transfers out) effectively subtracts those funds twice. This would artificially deflate the mETH exchange rate, allowing users to mint more mETH than they should during a `stake()` call. This is a high-impact vulnerability not mentioned in the ground truth."
