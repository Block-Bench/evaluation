While it lacks a reentrancy guard, the primary vulnerability in this specific code is the mathematical error in the K-invariant check (10000 vs 1000 scale). Furthermore, standard ERC20 transfers to a 'to' address do not typically allow for reentrancy unless the token is a non-standard one (like ERC777), and the finding does not specify this. More importantly, it completely misses the actual 100x math error which is the target vulnerability."
