Triggering a claim for someone else is generally considered a 'permissionless' action in DeFi that doesn't result in loss of funds. The model's claim that rewards might be sent to the caller is a mischaracterization of how Pendle markets work. The empty loop is a code quality issue but not a vulnerability in itself."
