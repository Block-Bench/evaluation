Because the function accepts a 'from' address and a 'to' address as parameters without verifying that msg.sender is the owner of the tokens, an attacker can observe a valid permit signature in the mempool and submit their own transaction with the same signature but a different 'to' address. This allows the attacker to steal the tokens being bridged. This is a distinct root cause from the original 'swallowed exception' bug."
