When `_earned()` is later called, it uses the actual `rewardGrowthGlobalX128`. This discrepancy causes the subtraction `rewardPerTokenInsideX128 - rewardPerTokenInsideInitialX128` to include historical rewards that accrued before the user deposited, allowing for immediate theft of rewards. This is a valid, high-severity vulnerability distinct from the ground truth."
