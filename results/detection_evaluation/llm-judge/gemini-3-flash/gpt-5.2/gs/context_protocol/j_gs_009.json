If `_to` is `address(0)`, the NFT is effectively burned, but the underlying locked tokens remain in the contract with no way to retrieve them, as all state-changing functions (withdraw, merge, etc.) require `_isApprovedOrOwner`, which would fail for the zero address. This is a valid security concern independent of the ground truth."
