The model's finding describes a missing step in the successful redemption flow (claiming), whereas the ground truth describes a failure to handle the rejection flow. Furthermore, the model's attack scenario assumes the gateway will have 0 balance because it didn't 'claim', but in many Midas-like architectures, the fulfillment might push tokens or the gateway is expected to hold them.
