Furthermore, the interface `IERC20` at LN-2-5 does not even define `_0x0cce35`, meaning this call would likely fail or behave unexpectedly depending on the actual token implementation. More importantly, the finding correctly identifies that shares are minted (LN-26, 27) before the transfer is attempted, and if the transfer fails without reverting, the contract is drained. This is a concrete, high-impact exploit."
