Furthermore, `BridgeHandler._0x6ff151` is also public and lacks a check to ensure it is only called by the `QuantumBridge` contract. This allows an attacker to trigger `transferFrom` on any token for any user who has approved the `BridgeHandler` contract. This is a valid, high-impact vulnerability existing in the code."
