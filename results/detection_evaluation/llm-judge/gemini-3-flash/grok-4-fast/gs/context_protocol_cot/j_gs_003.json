This is because `balance` is the current contract balance, while `rewardRate` is calculated based on the theoretical `leftover` (which assumes no rewards were claimed yet). If rewards were claimed, the actual balance is lower than the theoretical balance, causing the check to fail. This is a valid high-severity finding but is not the target vulnerability."
