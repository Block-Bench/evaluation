In Aave, aTokens (aWETH) are rebasing tokens where the balance increases over time to represent interest. The contract's `withdraw` function treats the `aWETH.balanceOf(address(this))` as the maximum amount of underlying WETH that can be withdrawn. However, in Aave v3, `pool.withdraw` takes the amount of *underlying* asset to withdraw, not the amount of shares to burn. Because the contract uses the share balance as a cap for the underlying withdrawal, it fails to account for the interest accrued (where 1 aToken > 1 underlying), effectively locking the yield in the contract. This is a valid, high-impact finding not mentioned in the ground truth."
