However, the `withdraw` function uses `aWETH.balanceOf(address(this))` to determine the `amountToWithdraw` passed to `pool.withdraw`. While Aave's `withdraw` function takes the underlying amount, the logic in this contract effectively caps the withdrawal at the initial share count if interest has accrued, or miscalculates the relationship between shares and underlying, potentially leaving yield locked in the contract. This is a distinct, valid technical issue not mentioned in the ground truth."
