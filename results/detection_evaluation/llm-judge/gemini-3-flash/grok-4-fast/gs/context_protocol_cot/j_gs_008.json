Passing `MAX_LOCK_DURATION` (usually 4 years in seconds) would result in a timestamp in the year 1974, causing the transaction to revert. Since it is wrapped in a try-catch, the lock is never extended, leading to voting power decay. This is a valid, high-impact finding not mentioned in the ground truth."
