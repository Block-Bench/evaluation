Specifically, it calls `_withdrawActiveVotingPower()` (which makes external calls to the plugin) before resetting `lockedBalances[msg.sender] = 0`. If a plugin is malicious or compromised, it can re-enter the contract. The described attack scenario where a user loses funds due to the state being overwritten after a re-entrant `lock()` call is technically sound and represents a real risk, although it requires a malicious plugin."
