However, the code in beforeSwap explicitly checks `require(-params.amountSpecified <= maxAmountIn)`, where `params.amountSpecified < 0` indicates an exact input swap in Uniswap V4. Thus, the check correctly limits the input amount before execution. Furthermore, the finding's attack scenario assumes an exact output swap, but the contract explicitly forbids this in beforeSwap with `require(params.amountSpecified < 0, ExactOutputDisabled())`. Therefore, the finding is based on a misunderstanding of the V4 swap parameters and the contract's logic."
