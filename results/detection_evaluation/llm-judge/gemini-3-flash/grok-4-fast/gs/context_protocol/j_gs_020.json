The code checks `-params.amountSpecified <= maxAmountIn`, which is correct for exact input. However, the finding points out that the hook fails to enforce the signed exchange rate/price limit during the swap execution (slippage), which is a valid concern for a signed quote system, although it misidentifies the units mismatch."

For a swap, `amountIn` should be positive and `amountOut` should be negative. The code defines `amountIn = -delta.amount0()` (making it negative) and `amountOut = delta.amount1()` (making it positive). This inversion causes the `egAmount` calculation and the subsequent `mint` logic to behave incorrectly, potentially allowing the extraction of funds when the user gets a worse rate, rather than capturing gains from a better rate."
