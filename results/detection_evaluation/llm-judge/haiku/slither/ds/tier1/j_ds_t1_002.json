The finding accurately detects the pattern: an external call via msg.sender.call.value() at line 16 followed by a state variable update (userBalance[msg.sender] = 0) at line 17. This is the exact reentrancy pattern described in the ground truth - an attacker's fallback function can recursively call withdrawBalance() before the balance is zeroed, draining funds. The check name 'reentrancy-eth' is semantically exact for this vulnerability type."

The tool correctly identified both the vulnerable function (withdrawBalance) and the specific vulnerable pattern: the external call to msg.sender.call.value() at line 16 preceding the state variable reset at line 17.
