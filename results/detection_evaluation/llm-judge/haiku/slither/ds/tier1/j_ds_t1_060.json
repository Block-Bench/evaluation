The tool correctly identifies that the return value is ignored. This matches the ground truth vulnerability (unchecked_return) - the semantic pattern is identical: a low-level call without checking the return value. Even though Slither names it 'unchecked-lowlevel' rather than 'unchecked-return', it detects the exact same underlying vulnerability pattern at the correct vulnerable location."

The finding correctly identifies the vulnerable function, the specific vulnerable line, and the vulnerability pattern.

The tool's overall analysis is accurate and helpful for security review.",
