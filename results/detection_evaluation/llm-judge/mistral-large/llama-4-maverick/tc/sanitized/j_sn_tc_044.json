However, the contract uses ERC20's `transfer` method, which does not allow reentrancy because it does not call back into the contract. The Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern is correctly followed in spirit, as the state changes (`balanceOf` and `totalSupply` updates) occur before the external call (`underlying.transfer`). Thus, this is not a real reentrancy vulnerability."

However, the `exchangeRate` function already handles the case where `totalSupply` is zero by returning a default value (1e18). While this is a valid observation, it does not constitute a critical or medium-severity vulnerability because the contract gracefully handles the edge case. Thus, this is informational rather than a security issue."
