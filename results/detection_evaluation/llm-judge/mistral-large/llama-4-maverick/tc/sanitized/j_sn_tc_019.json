Additionally, while the location (swap function) matches, the root cause is entirely different, so this cannot be a TARGET_MATCH or PARTIAL_MATCH. The reentrancy claim is also mischaracterized because the contract uses ERC20's `transfer`, which does not allow reentrancy (unlike `transferFrom` or `call`)."
