This matches the ground truth's root cause of instant voting power from deposits with no time-weighting or holding period, combined with the `emergencyCommit` function enabling immediate execution.\n        3. **Type Match**: The type 'Flash Loan Attack' is a semantic match to 'governance_attack' as it describes the same attack vector (flash loans enabling governance manipulation).\n        The attack scenario and suggested fix also align with the ground truth, demonstrating a clear understanding of the vulnerability.\n      "
