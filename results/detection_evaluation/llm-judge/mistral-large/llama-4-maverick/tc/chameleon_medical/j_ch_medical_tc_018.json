However, the contract uses Solidity 0.8.0, which has built-in protections against reentrancy when using standard ERC20 tokens (unless the token itself is malicious and implements reentrancy). The Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern is not strictly necessary here because the state updates (`baseAccountcredits` and `quoteAccountcredits`) are done before the final `transfer` calls, and the intermediate `transferFrom` calls are to trusted ERC20 tokens (assuming standard implementations). This is not a concrete reentrancy vulnerability."
