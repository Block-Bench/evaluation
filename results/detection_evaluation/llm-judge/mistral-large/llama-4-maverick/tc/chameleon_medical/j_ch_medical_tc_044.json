However, the contract follows the checks-effects-interactions pattern correctly in `claimResources`: state variables (`balanceOf` and `totalSupply`) are updated before the external call to `underlying.transfer`. The external call is the last operation, so reentrancy is not possible. The `issueCredential` function also follows this pattern correctly. Thus, the vulnerability does not exist as described."
