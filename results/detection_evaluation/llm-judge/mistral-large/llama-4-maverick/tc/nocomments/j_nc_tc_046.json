However, the contract uses WETH (an ERC20 token), which does not have reentrancy capabilities unless the recipient is a malicious contract that implements a reentrant fallback function. The contract's state is updated (playerSettings and playerBalances are deleted) before the WETH transfer, which follows the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern. Thus, the reentrancy attack scenario described is not feasible in this context. The finding is a mischaracterization of the code's actual behavior."
