However, the contract uses Solidity 0.8.0, which has built-in protections against integer overflow/underflow and reentrancy. The external calls in the mentioned functions do not expose the contract to reentrancy because the state is either updated before the external call (e.g., in `withdrawCollateral`, `collateralBalance[msg.sender]` is updated before `collateralToken.transfer`) or the external call is the last operation (e.g., in `borrow`, `shezUSD.transfer` is the last operation). Thus, this is a mischaracterization of the code."
