However, the `asset.transfer` call is made to an ERC20 token, which is not typically reentrant unless the token itself is malicious. The contract does not show any reentrancy guards, but the attack scenario requires a malicious ERC20 token, which is not a standard assumption. The state update (`borrows[msg.sender] += amount`) is done before the external call, which follows the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern. Thus, this is not a reentrancy vulnerability as described."
