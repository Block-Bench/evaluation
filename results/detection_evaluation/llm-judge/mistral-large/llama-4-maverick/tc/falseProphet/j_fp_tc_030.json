While the terminology differs, both describe the same underlying issue: lack of validation over external calls with user-controlled data, leading to unauthorized actions.\n\n        **Attack Scenario**: The finding's attack scenario is slightly different from the ground truth (malicious route contract vs. token draining via transferFrom), but it still demonstrates a concrete, valid exploit path that aligns with the root cause. The ground truth's attack scenario is more specific to the real-world exploit, but the finding's scenario is plausible and technically correct.\n\n        **Fix Suggestion**: The suggested fixes (reentrancy protection, calldata validation, whitelisting allowed functions) are valid and align with the ground truth's recommendations. While the ground truth emphasizes whitelisting function selectors, the finding's broader suggestions are still correct and remediate the issue.\n      "
