However, the contract uses the `nonReentrant` modifier on `claimFees()`, which is the public function calling `_claimFees`. The `nonReentrant` modifier prevents reentrancy attacks, making this finding mischaracterized. The interaction with `internal_bribe` does not introduce a reentrancy risk because the modifier is applied."

This is a valid security concern, as it could lead to front-running or approval-related exploits if `rHYBR` is malicious. The suggested fix (resetting approval to zero) is also correct.
