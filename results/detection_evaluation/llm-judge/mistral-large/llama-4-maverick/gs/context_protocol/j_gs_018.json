However, the contract inherits from `ReentrancyGuardTrait` and uses the `nonReentrant` modifier on the `withdraw` function, which prevents reentrancy. The external call to `safeTransfer` is protected by this modifier, making reentrancy impossible. Thus, the code is not actually vulnerable to this issue."
