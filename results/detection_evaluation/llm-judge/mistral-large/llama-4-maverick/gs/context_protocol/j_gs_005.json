However, the contract uses the `nonReentrant` modifier on all public functions that call `_vote`, and the `_vote` function itself is internal. While the finding is technically correct that the internal function isn't protected, the attack scenario is implausible because: 1) The public functions calling `_vote` are protected by `nonReentrant`, and 2) The bribe contracts would need to be malicious, which is an assumption not grounded in the protocol's design (bribe contracts are typically trusted in ve(3,3) systems). This doesn't match the TARGET vulnerability and is more of a design choice than a concrete vulnerability."
