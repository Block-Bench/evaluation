However, the `SafeERC20Upgradeable.safePermit` and `safeTransferFrom` functions are designed to be reentrancy-safe, and the contract does not perform state changes after these calls that could be exploited. The `unstakeRequestsManager.create` call is made before the `safeTransferFrom`, and the state changes (e.g., locking mETH) are done in a way that does not expose the contract to reentrancy. Thus, this is not a genuine reentrancy vulnerability."
