The root cause and location do not match the ground truth. The reentrancy claim is also not substantiated by the ground truth or the code's logic, as the state change (`lockedBalances[msg.sender] = 0`) occurs after the external call, but there is no evidence of a reentrancy attack vector that would allow draining funds or manipulating state in a meaningful way. This is a mischaracterization of the actual issue."
