While reentrancy is theoretically possible if the `poolManager` is malicious, this is not a concrete attack scenario given the protocol's design. The `poolManager` is a trusted core contract in Uniswap V4, and reentrancy here would require compromising the `poolManager` itself, which is out of scope for this audit. Thus, this is not a valid vulnerability in the given context."
