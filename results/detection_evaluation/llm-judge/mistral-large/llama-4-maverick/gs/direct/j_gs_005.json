However, the contract uses the `nonReentrant` modifier on the external functions (`vote` and `poke`) that call `_vote`, which mitigates reentrancy risks. The `_vote` function itself is internal and not directly callable externally, further reducing the risk. The finding does not demonstrate a concrete attack scenario that bypasses the reentrancy guard, making it a mischaracterization of the actual code behavior."
