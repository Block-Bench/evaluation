This is a standard conversion pattern and does not inherently lead to precision loss beyond what is expected in such conversions. The function is used for minReceiveAmount, which is a protective measure, and the conversion is mathematically correct for its purpose. No concrete attack scenario is demonstrated where this would lead to exploitable precision loss."
