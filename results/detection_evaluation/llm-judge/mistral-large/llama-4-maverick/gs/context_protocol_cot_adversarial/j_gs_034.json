The ground truth describes a logic error where fees become stranded due to the order of operations in the unlock function (setting lockedUntil to 0 before transferring LP tokens, which prevents subsequent fee claims). The reentrancy claim is incorrect because: 1) The contract uses ReentrancyGuardTransient (nonReentrant modifier), which prevents reentrancy. 2) The token transfers are done using SafeERC20, which is not vulnerable to reentrancy. 3) The actual issue is about fee stranding due to state changes before external calls, not reentrancy."
