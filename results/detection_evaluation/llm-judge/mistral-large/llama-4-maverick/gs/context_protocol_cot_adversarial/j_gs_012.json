However, the `unlock` function does not involve any state changes after the external call that could be exploited for reentrancy. The locked balance is set to 0 before the external call, and the transfer occurs after, making reentrancy exploitation unlikely. This does not match the ground truth vulnerability and is not a concrete, exploitable reentrancy issue."
