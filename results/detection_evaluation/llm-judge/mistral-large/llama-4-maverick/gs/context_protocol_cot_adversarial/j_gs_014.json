However, the contract does not appear to have any state changes after the external call that could be exploited in a reentrancy attack. The lockedBalances[msg.sender] is set to 0 and _doUnlockTransfer is called after _withdrawActiveVotingPower(), but there's no indication that the plugin can reenter unlock() in a way that would manipulate the contract's state. This is likely a false positive or mischaracterization of the potential risk."
