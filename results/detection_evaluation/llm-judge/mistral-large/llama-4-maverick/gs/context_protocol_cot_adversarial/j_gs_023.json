      "reasoning": "The finding suggests that a malicious position manager could manipulate the contract's state by sending ETH. However, the function `receiveETHFromPositionManager` is a simple payable function that does not alter the contract's state beyond receiving ETH. The contract's accounting is handled in other functions, and the `onlyPositionManagerContract` modifier ensures only registered and active managers can call it. There is no concrete attack scenario provided that demonstrates how this could lead to loss of funds or unauthorized access. Thus, this is not a valid security vulnerability but rather a design choice."

Without a concrete attack scenario demonstrating how an unreasonable `drawdownAmount` could lead to loss of funds or critical state manipulation, this is at best an informational issue.
