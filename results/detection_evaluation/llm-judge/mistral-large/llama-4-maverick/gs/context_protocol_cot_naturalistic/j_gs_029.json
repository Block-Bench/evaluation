However, `selfExecute` is protected by the `onlySelf` modifier, which restricts calls to the contract itself, and the contract inherits from `ReentrancyGuard` with `nonReentrant` applied to `execute`. While `selfExecute` is not explicitly marked `nonReentrant`, the `onlySelf` modifier mitigates reentrancy risks since external contracts cannot call it. Thus, this is not a genuine reentrancy vulnerability."
