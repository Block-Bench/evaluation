However, the `send` function is used after the game state is updated, which follows the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern. The `send` function is also limited to 2300 gas, making reentrancy highly unlikely. The contract does not have a fallback function that could reenter the contract, and the state is updated before the external call. Thus, this is not a valid reentrancy vulnerability."
