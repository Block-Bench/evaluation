Callback occurred after balance updates but before finalization, creating state inconsistency exploitable through repeated self-transfers.'\n\n        **Location Match**: While the finding specifies `_notifyTransfer` as the location, the vulnerability stems from the `transfer` function's use of `_notifyTransfer`. The ground truth specifies `transfer` as the vulnerable function, and since `_notifyTransfer` is called within `transfer`, this is a semantic match for location. The core issue is the reentrancy vector in the transfer flow, which the finding correctly identifies.\n\n        **Type Match**: The type 'Reentrancy / Unsafe External Call' is a semantic match to the ground truth's 'reentrancy'.\n\n        The finding also provides a concrete attack scenario that aligns with the ground truth's description, though it focuses on a cross-contract reentrancy scenario rather than the self-transfer loop described in the ground truth.
