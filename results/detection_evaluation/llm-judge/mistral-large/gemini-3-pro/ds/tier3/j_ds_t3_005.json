The finding correctly identifies the `Engine` contract as the location, which contains these functions. The attack scenario explicitly involves calling `initialize()` and `upgradeToAndCall()`, matching the ground truth's specified functions.\n\n        **Type Match**: The finding labels the vulnerability as 'Uninitialized Implementation Contract', which is a semantic match to the ground truth's 'logic_error'.
