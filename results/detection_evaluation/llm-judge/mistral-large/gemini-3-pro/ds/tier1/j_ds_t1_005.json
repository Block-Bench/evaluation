This matches the ground truth's core issue, even though the ground truth did not specify the root cause explicitly.\n        2. **Location Match**: The finding correctly identifies the vulnerable location as the `set` function in the IAlice interface vs the Alice contract, which matches the ground truth's specified function.\n        3. **Type Match**: The vulnerability type 'Function Signature Mismatch / Fallback Trigger' is a semantic match to the ground truth's 'interface_mismatch'.
