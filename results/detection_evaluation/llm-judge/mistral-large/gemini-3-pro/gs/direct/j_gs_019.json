The finding, however, describes a different issue: the omission of the `tokenOut` parameter in the `_withdraw` call to the gateway, which would cause a function selector mismatch or ambiguous behavior. This is a distinct root cause from the ground truth, and the location, while overlapping, is not sufficient to constitute a match since the core issue is different."
