The model's finding instead focuses on the allocation cap being exceeded, which is a different root cause (though both lead to DOS). The location is also slightly off - the ground truth specifies `updatePositionManager` as the vulnerable function, while the model points to `depositETH`. The core issue (DOS due to auto-allocation logic) is related, but the specific root cause and location do not match the ground truth."
