The location (deposit function) and the specific root cause (lack of minimum share minting and external donation vectors) match the ground truth. The type 'Economic Exploit' is a semantic match to 'logic_error' as it describes the same class of vulnerability (share price manipulation). The attack scenario and suggested fix are also valid and align with the ground truth."
