However, the ground truth vulnerability is about unclaimed fees being stranded due to the `onlyLocked` modifier in `claimFees()` after `unlock()` is called. The root cause and location do not match the ground truth. Additionally, the scenario described (accidental direct transfers) is not the primary issue described in the ground truth, and the fix suggested does not address the fee stranding problem."
