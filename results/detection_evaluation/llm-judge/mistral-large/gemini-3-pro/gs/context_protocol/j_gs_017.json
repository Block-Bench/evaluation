The finding instead describes a different issue: using the raw ERC20 `totalSupply` (which includes unlocked tokens) rather than the total locked tokens in the `LockManager`. While both issues relate to threshold calculations, they are distinct root causes with different attack vectors and fixes. The location is broadly correct (LockToVotePlugin.sol), but the specific function (`currentTokenSupply`) and root cause do not match the ground truth."
