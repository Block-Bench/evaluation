The location matches one of the ground truth functions, but the root cause is entirely different. Thus, this cannot be a TARGET_MATCH or PARTIAL_MATCH.

However, the root cause described (lack of access control on the function itself) is only a subset of the ground truth root cause (single private key compromise allowing arbitrary contract upgrades without timelock or multi-sig). The ground truth is broader and involves admin key compromise and upgrade mechanisms, while this finding focuses on a specific function's access control.
