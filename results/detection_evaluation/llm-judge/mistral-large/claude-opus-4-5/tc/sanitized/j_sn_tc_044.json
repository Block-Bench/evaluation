While it doesn't mention `redeem` or `balanceOfUnderlying`, the core issue is captured in `exchangeRate` and `mint`, which are sufficient for a match.\n\n        **Type Match**: The type 'First Depositor / Donation Attack' is a semantic match to 'oracle_manipulation' as described in the ground truth.
