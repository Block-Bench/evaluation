The primary focus on `deposit` aligns with the ground truth.\n\n        **Type Match**: The type 'Deflationary Token Accounting Mismatch' is a semantic match to 'token_incompatibility' as both describe the same underlying issue of incompatibility with deflationary token mechanics.\n\n        **Quality**: The root cause, attack scenario, and fix suggestion are all technically accurate and align with the ground truth's requirements.
