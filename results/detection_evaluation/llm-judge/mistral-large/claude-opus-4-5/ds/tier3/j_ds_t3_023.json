The inclusion of `initMultiowned` and `initDaylimit` is accurate as they share the same root cause and are part of the same vulnerability.\n\n        **Type Match**: The type 'Unprotected Initialization (Delegatecall Context Vulnerability)' is a semantic match to 'access_control' as it describes a failure in access control during initialization in a delegatecall context.\n\n        The attack scenario and fix suggestions are concrete, technically accurate, and align with the known Parity Wallet Library vulnerability.\n      "
