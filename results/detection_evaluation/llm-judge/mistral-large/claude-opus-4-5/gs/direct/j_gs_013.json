The issue is concrete: the contract does not check the return value of `transferFrom`, which can fail silently for certain ERC20 tokens (e.g., USDT). The attack scenario is valid and step-by-step, demonstrating how an attacker could exploit this to credit themselves with tokens they never deposited. The impact is genuine (loss of funds for other users) and does not require a trusted role to be compromised. The suggested fix (using SafeERC20) is valid and remediates the issue."
