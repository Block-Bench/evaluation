The model's explanation of attacker-controlled voting power aligns with the ground truth's description of flash loan governance attacks, as both highlight the lack of constraints on voting power acquisition and immediate execution.\n\n        **Location Match**: The finding correctly identifies `emergencyCommit()` as the vulnerable function (matching ground truth). While it also mentions `deposit()` and `propose()`, these are relevant to the attack vector and not incorrect, as the vulnerability stems from the interaction of these functions.\n\n        **Type Match**: The type 'Unbacked voting power enables arbitrary call execution (governance bypass)' is a semantic match to 'governance_attack'.
