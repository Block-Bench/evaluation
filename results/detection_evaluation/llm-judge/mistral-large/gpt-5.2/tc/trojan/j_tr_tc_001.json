The model's finding, however, describes a lack of access control on `setAcceptedRoot()`, which is a different issue entirely. While both involve `acceptedRoot`, the root causes are distinct: one is about improper initialization, the other is about missing access control. The location claimed includes the correct function (`process`) but also incorrectly includes `setAcceptedRoot()`, which is not part of the ground truth vulnerability.
