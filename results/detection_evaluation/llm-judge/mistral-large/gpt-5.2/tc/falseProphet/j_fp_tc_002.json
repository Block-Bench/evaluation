The ground truth specifies 'Governance system allowed instant voting power from deposits with no time-weighting or holding period' and 'emergencyCommit() enabled immediate execution', which aligns with the finding's explanation of 'grants voting power purely by incrementing internal accounting in deposit() without transferring/locking any real asset'.\n\n        **Location Match**: While the ground truth specifies the vulnerable function as 'emergencyCommit', the root cause originates from the 'deposit()' function's voting power accounting. The finding correctly identifies the root cause location (deposit()) and its impact on the emergencyCommit() function. The ground truth's attack scenario involves both deposit and emergencyCommit, so the location is effectively matched.\n\n        **Type Match**: The finding's type 'Free minting of voting power enables governance takeover and arbitrary execution' is a semantic match to the ground truth's 'governance_attack'. Both describe the same vulnerability class where governance can be manipulated through voting power exploitation.\n\n        The finding provides a concrete attack scenario that mirrors the ground truth's flash loan governance attack, though it simplifies the attack vector (direct deposit manipulation vs flash loan). This is still valid as it demonstrates the same root cause vulnerability."
