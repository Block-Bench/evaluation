The ground truth does not mention this function or any access control issues, and the described attack scenario does not align with the TARGET vulnerability (arithmetic manipulation via flashloan cycles). The function does not interact with the liquidityIndex or involve any arithmetic operations, so it is not relevant to the TARGET vulnerability.
