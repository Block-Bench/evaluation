These are unrelated vulnerabilities.\n2. **Location Mismatch**: While the finding mentions `_withdrawActiveVotingPower`, the core issue it describes (unprotected initialization + reentrancy) is not the TARGET vulnerability.

The `unlock()` function does not appear to have a reentrancy vulnerability as described, because `lockedBalances[msg.sender]` is set to 0 *after* the external calls to the plugin, which is the correct order for checks-effects-interactions.
