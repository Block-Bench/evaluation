This matches the ground truth's description of 'missing or incorrect authorization checks' in the `initWallet` function. The explanation explicitly states that ANY address can call `initWallet` first and set themselves as an owner, which aligns with the ground truth's access control vulnerability.\n        2. **Location Match**: The finding correctly identifies the vulnerable functions (`initWallet`, `initMultiowned`, `initDaylimit`), with `initWallet` being the primary function specified in the ground truth. The inclusion of `initMultiowned` and `initDaylimit` is valid as they are part of the same initialization flow.\n        3. **Type Match**: The type 'Unprotected initialization / ownership takeover (Parity-style)' is a semantic match to 'access_control' as described in the ground truth.
