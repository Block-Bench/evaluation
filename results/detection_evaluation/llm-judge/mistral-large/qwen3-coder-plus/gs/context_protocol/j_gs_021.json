The ground truth specifically highlights that the signature is bound to the router contract rather than the end user, enabling front-running by any user who can forward the calldata through the same router. The finding's attack scenario (reusing signatures for different swap amounts) is also different from the ground truth's front-running scenario (nonce consumption via dust swaps). Thus, while the location matches, the root cause and attack scenario do not align with the ground truth."
