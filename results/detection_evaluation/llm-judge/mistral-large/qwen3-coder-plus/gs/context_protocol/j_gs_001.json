However, the ground truth root cause is specifically about the order of operations in the deposit function - depositing tokens into the votingEscrow before calculating shares, which causes users to suffer slippage from their own deposits. The finding does not address this specific issue, instead focusing on a different attack vector (small deposits during initialization). Thus, the root cause does not match the ground truth."
