Reentrancy requires state changes to be exploitable. The external calls to `token.balanceOf` and `lockManager.getLockedBalance` are read-only operations and cannot trigger reentrancy. The attack scenario about flash loans manipulating balances is unrelated to reentrancy and is more about oracle manipulation or timing attacks, which are not applicable here since the function is `view`."
