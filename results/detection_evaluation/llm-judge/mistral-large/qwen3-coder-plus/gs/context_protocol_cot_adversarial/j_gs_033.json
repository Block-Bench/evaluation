However, the `deploy` function uses `create2` with `callvalue()`, which forwards the entire `msg.value` to the new contract. The new wallet contract (Wallet.sol) would receive the funds, not the factory. The factory does not retain any ether, so there is no unprotected ether withdrawal vulnerability here. The issue is mischaracterized as the funds are not at risk of being lost or stuck in the factory."
