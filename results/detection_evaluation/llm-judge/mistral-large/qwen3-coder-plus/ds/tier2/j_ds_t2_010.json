The finding correctly identifies that the password is stored in predictable storage slots (slot 0 and slot 1 via the users array), making it accessible through storage layout analysis. While the ground truth does not specify a root cause, the finding's explanation aligns with the core issue: sensitive data is exposed due to on-chain storage in predictable locations.\n        2. **Location Match**: The ground truth specifies the constructor as the vulnerable function. The finding mentions the constructor and storage layout, which is a broader but accurate location since the vulnerability stems from how data is stored during construction.\n        3. **Type Match**: The finding uses 'Information Exposure', which is a semantic match to the ground truth's 'data_exposure'.
