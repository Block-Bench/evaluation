The model instead describes a different issue: manipulation of the pool's balance by directly sending tokens to the contract, which is a separate vulnerability (balance manipulation via direct transfers). While the location matches (deposit and withdraw functions), the root cause is fundamentally different. The ground truth focuses on the initial deposit condition and share calculation rounding, whereas the model focuses on external balance manipulation."
