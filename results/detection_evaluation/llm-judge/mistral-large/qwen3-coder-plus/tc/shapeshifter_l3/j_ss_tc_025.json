However, the code does not show any reentrancy risk because: 1) The deposit function (_0x2c833f) updates state AFTER the external call, but the external call is to a standard ERC20 transferFrom, which does not call back into the Vault contract. 2) The withdrawal function (_0x347a3f) updates state BEFORE the external call, following the checks-effects-interactions pattern. 3) The DeflatToken contract does not have any callback mechanisms that would enable reentrancy. Thus, this is a mischaracterization of the code."
