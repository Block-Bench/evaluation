However, it does not mention the _0xd6cb4d function, which is also part of the ground truth. Thus, the location is partially correct.\n\n        **Type Match**: The type 'Minting Privilege Escalation' is semantically related to 'access_control' but is more specific and not an exact or semantic match to the ground truth type.
