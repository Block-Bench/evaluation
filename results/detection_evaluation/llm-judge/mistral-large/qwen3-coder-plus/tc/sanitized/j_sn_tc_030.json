The ground truth specifies both `executeRoute` and `performAction` as vulnerable functions, and the finding's focus on `performAction` is sufficient since it is the direct location of the vulnerability.\n\n        **Type Match**: The type 'Arbitrary External Call' is a semantic match to the ground truth's 'access_control'.

The explanation precisely matches the ground truth's root cause, including the specific weakness of arbitrary external calls with user data.\n        - **Attack Vector Validity (AVA)**: HIGH (0.9). The attack scenario is concrete and aligns with the ground truth, though it focuses more on `fromToken` being user-controlled (which is not the primary issue in the ground truth).
