The contract does not have a reentrancy guard, but the attack scenario requires a malicious token, which is a less common and more specific threat. The root cause does not match the ground truth (price oracle manipulation), and the location is broader than the ground truth (includes dischargeFunds). The finding is not hallucinated but is mischaracterized as the primary risk is not reentrancy in this context."
