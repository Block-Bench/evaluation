The ground truth specifies that EthCrossChainManager didn't restrict which contracts could be targeted for execution, allowing calls to privileged functions on EthCrossChainData. The finding's explanation aligns with this, noting that the `_decodeTx` function hardcodes the target contract as `dataContract` and that the execution pathway bypasses `onlyOwner` protection.\n\n        **Location Match**: The finding correctly identifies the vulnerable functions as `verifyHeaderAndExecuteTx` and `_decodeTx`, which matches the ground truth's specification of `verifyHeaderAndExecuteTx` (the core vulnerable function) and its internal helper `_decodeTx`.\n\n        **Type Match**: The type 'Arbitrary Cross-Chain Call Execution' is a semantic match to the ground truth's 'access_control'. Both describe the same underlying issue: lack of access control on cross-chain execution targets.\n\n        The finding's attack scenario is also consistent with the ground truth, describing how an attacker can craft malicious proof data to execute privileged functions on CrossChainData.
