Instead, it focuses on the symptom (admin override capability) rather than the systemic issue (lack of multi-sig/timelock).\n        2. **Location Match**: The finding only mentions `setLockRecipient`, but the ground truth includes multiple functions (`setLockRecipient`, `emergencyUnlock`, `setConfigStorage`, `transferAdmin`). While the location is partially correct, it is incomplete.\n        3. **Type Match**: The claimed type 'Logic Flaw - Admin Override Capability' is a partial semantic match to 'access_control' but is not precise. The ground truth emphasizes systemic access control failures (single key, no multi-sig), while the finding focuses on a specific logic flaw.\n        Thus, this is a PARTIAL_MATCH because the root cause and location are partially correct, but the type is imprecise and the root cause is not fully aligned with ground truth.\n      "
