While `getExchangeRate` is not explicitly mentioned, the root cause is still correctly identified in the primary vulnerable functions.\n\n        **Type Match**: The type 'Mint-Burn Exchange Rate Manipulation' is a semantic match to the ground truth's 'logic_error', as both describe the same underlying issue of incorrect exchange rate logic.\n\n        **Quality Scoring**:\n        - **RCIR**: HIGH (0.9). The root cause is accurately and specifically identified, matching the ground truth.\n        - **AVA**: HIGH (0.8).
