Additionally, the attack scenario for reentrancy is not feasible because the wallet constructor does not have the ability to call back into the factory during deployment (create2 does not allow reentrancy in this context). The front-running scenario is also mischaracterized as it does not align with the ground truth's focus on the revert behavior."
