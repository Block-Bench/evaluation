The condition `_newVotingPower == 0 || _newVotingPower < _currentVotingPower` correctly rejects zero voting power when `_currentVotingPower` is zero because `_newVotingPower < _currentVotingPower` (0 < 0) is false, making the entire condition true only if `_newVotingPower == 0` is true. However, the function returns false in this case, which is the correct behavior. The attack scenario is thus invalid as zero-power votes are not allowed."
