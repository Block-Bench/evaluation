However, this is not a vulnerability but rather a design choice - the EXECUTOR_ROLE is intended to manage deposits, and the funds would come from the caller's wallet, not the protocol's. The attack scenario does not result in loss of protocol funds, only potential misuse of the caller's own funds if the role is compromised. This does not match the TARGET vulnerability's root cause or location."
