The finding instead describes a missing access control issue in `_0x390062`, where ANY caller can set `_0x7d6277` to an arbitrary value.

The root cause and attack scenario are tied to the validation logic in `_0x2ff8d2`, not the setter function `_0x390062`.\n        - **Type Mismatch**: The ground truth type is `improper_initialization`, while the finding claims `Access Control / Unauthorized State Change`.
