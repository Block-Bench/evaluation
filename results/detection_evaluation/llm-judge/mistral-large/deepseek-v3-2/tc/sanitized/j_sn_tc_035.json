However, the location (borrow function) is correct, and the issue is real. For the TARGET vulnerability, this does not match the root cause (oracle manipulation) or type (price_oracle_manipulation). Thus, it cannot be classified as TARGET_MATCH or PARTIAL_MATCH for the target. It is a separate, valid vulnerability."
