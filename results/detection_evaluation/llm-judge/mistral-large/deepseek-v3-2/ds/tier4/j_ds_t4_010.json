This matches the ground truth's description of read-only reentrancy leading to unintended price changes.\n        2. **Location Match**: While the ground truth specifies `getReward` as the vulnerable function, the finding correctly identifies the attack vector involving `performReadOnlyCallback()` and `receive()`, which are the entry points for the reentrancy. The core issue (reentrancy in `getReward`) is still the focus, and the location is effectively the same attack path.\n        3. **Type Match**: The type 'Reentrancy with Price Manipulation' is a semantic match to 'reentrancy' in the ground truth, as it describes the same vulnerability class with additional context about the attack vector (price manipulation).\n      "
