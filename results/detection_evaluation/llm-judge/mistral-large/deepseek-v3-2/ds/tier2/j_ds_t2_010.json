The ground truth does not specify a root cause, but the finding's explanation aligns with the implicit root cause (false sense of privacy in storage variables).\n        2. **Location Match**: The ground truth specifies the 'constructor' as the vulnerable function, but the finding broadens the location to 'contract storage slots'. While the constructor initializes the sensitive data, the actual vulnerability is the storage of sensitive data in slots, which is a more accurate and comprehensive location. This is acceptable because the constructor's role in initializing the data is part of the broader storage issue.\n        3. **Type Match**: 'Storage Privacy Violation' is a semantic match to 'data_exposure', as both describe the same underlying issue of sensitive data being exposed despite being marked private.\n      "
