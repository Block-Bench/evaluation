The root cause described in the finding (inconsistent share calculation between initial and subsequent deposits) does not match the ground truth root cause (manipulatable oracle price used in share calculations). Additionally, the location is partially correct (submitPayment function) but the specific issue is different. Thus, the root cause does not match the ground truth, so this cannot be TARGET_MATCH or PARTIAL_MATCH."
