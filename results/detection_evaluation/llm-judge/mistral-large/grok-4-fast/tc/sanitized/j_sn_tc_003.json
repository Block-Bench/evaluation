The finding instead describes a reinitialization attack on the *proxy contract* (via delegatecall) to overwrite owners and drain funds, which is a different issue.\n        - **Location Mismatch**: The ground truth specifies the `kill` function as the vulnerable function (since the attack culminates in calling `kill` after reinitialization). The finding focuses on `initWallet` and does not mention `kill`.\n        - **Attack Scenario Mismatch**: The ground truth describes an attack where the library is destroyed (selfdestruct), freezing all dependent proxies. The finding describes an attack where the proxy is reinitialized to drain funds, which is not the Parity multi-sig wallet vulnerability.\n        - **Type Mismatch**: While both are access control issues, the specific type (library selfdestruct vs proxy reinitialization) is different.\n      "
