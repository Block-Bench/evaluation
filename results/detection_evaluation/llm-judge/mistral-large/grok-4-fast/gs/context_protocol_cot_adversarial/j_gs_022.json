The finding instead focuses on ETH reception via `receive()` and `fallback()` functions, which is a different issue entirely.\n\n        2. **Location Mismatch**: The ground truth targets `updatePositionManager`, while the finding targets `receive()`, `fallback()`, and internal functions calling `IPositionManager.withdraw()`. These are unrelated to the ground truth vulnerability.\n\n        3. **Attack Scenario Validity**: The attack scenario described in the finding is plausible (ETH transfers from position managers failing due to reverting `receive()`), but it does not match the ground truth's attack scenario. The finding's scenario is also somewhat speculative because it assumes position managers use `transfer()` or `sendValue()` instead of explicit function calls, which may not be the case given the existence of `receiveETHFromPositionManager()`.\n\n        4. **Impact Overstated**: The finding labels the severity as 'critical', but the impact is contingent on position managers using `transfer()`/`sendValue()`, which is not guaranteed. The ground truth's issue is more directly impactful as it can block allocation flows without requiring assumptions about external contract behavior.\n\n        5. **Fix Suggestion**: The suggested fix (removing reverts from `receive()`/`fallback()`) is reasonable for the described issue but does not address the ground truth vulnerability.
