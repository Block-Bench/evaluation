The unlock() function itself does not violate Checks-Effects-Interactions in a way that allows reentrancy against the contract's state, as the balance is only cleared after the external call. The external call is to a fixed address set at initialization. The finding mischaracterizes the Access Control/Initialization race condition as a standard reentrancy bug."
