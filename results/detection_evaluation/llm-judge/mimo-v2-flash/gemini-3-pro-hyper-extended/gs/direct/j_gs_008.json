However, the `_beforeTokenTransfer` hook calls `_cleanExpired`, which removes expired locks. If the attacker makes many small deposits to the victim, the victim simply has many locks. If the victim waits until the `transferLockPeriod` (default 24 hours) expires for all locks, the `_cleanExpired` function will remove all entries in a single transaction (gas permitting, though it might be high). If the victim transfers before expiration, the loop iterates over active locks. The finding assumes the loop always consumes excessive gas, but if the locks are expired, they are removed. The attack is theoretically possible if the victim is forced to transfer while all locks are active, but it is not a permanent freeze as implied. The fix suggested (consolidating locks) is valid, but the classification as a critical DoS is an overstatement of the vulnerability's impact.",
