However, the contract contains a real DOS vulnerability in the poke() function as described in the ground truth. The vulnerability occurs when a user votes with dust amounts (e.g., 1 wei) on a pool, and after time passes and voting power decays, the calculation `_poolWeight = _weights[i] * _weight / _totalVoteWeight` rounds down to 0, causing the subsequent require statement `require(_poolWeight != 0, \"ZV\")` to revert. This makes the user's votes unpokable, preventing them from updating their votes to reflect decayed voting power, which breaks the intended ve(3,3) mechanism and gives them an unfair advantage in reward distribution.",
