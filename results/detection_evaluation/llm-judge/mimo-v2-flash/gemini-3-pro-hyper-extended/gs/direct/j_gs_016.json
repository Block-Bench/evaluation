However, the ground truth vulnerability is about **blacklisted/frozen tokens** (e.g., USDC/USDT) where the user holds tokens but cannot transfer/lock them. While both involve using `token.balanceOf`, the specific root cause and attack vector differ. The ground truth focuses on the inability to lock due to external restrictions, whereas this finding focuses on temporary ownership via flash loans.
