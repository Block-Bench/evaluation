However, this contract is NOT a standard ERC4626 vault. The `totalAssets()` function returns the locked amount from the external `votingEscrow` contract, not the contract's token balance. An attacker cannot simply 'donate' HYBR to the veNFT to inflate `totalAssets()` because the `votingEscrow` contract would not credit the veNFT with that amount. The veNFT's locked balance is strictly controlled by the `votingEscrow` contract's internal accounting. The attack vector described relies on an assumption that does not hold for this specific architecture."

While this is a common behavior in some implementations, it is not a universal truth and assumes a specific behavior of the external `votingEscrow` contract which is not provided. More importantly, the finding overlooks the `withdrawFee`. Even if a user holds 100% of the shares, the `remainingAmount` is calculated as `veBalance - userAmount - feeAmount`. Since `feeAmount` is strictly positive (default 1%, minimum 0.1%), `remainingAmount` will always be greater than 0 as long as `veBalance > userAmount`. The fee ensures the contract always retains a dust amount, preventing the zero-amount scenario described."
