However, `cumulativeDrawdown()` tracks the total ETH withdrawn from the buffer to other protocol components. If this amount were not subtracted, the `totalControlled()` would double-count funds that have already been moved out of the buffer's custody and into other parts of the protocol (e.g., `unstakeRequestsManager`). The current implementation correctly reflects the net assets under the buffer's direct control. The scenario described (attacker staking when NAV is low) is not a valid exploit because the NAV calculation is correct."
