The code in afterSwap uses unchecked blocks and signed integer conversions that are actually correct for the V4 delta system: delta.amount0() and delta.amount1() are int128. When params.zeroForOne is true, amountIn = -delta.amount0() (delta.amount0 is positive input, so negative makes it negative), amountOut = delta.amount1() (delta.amount1 is negative output, so stays negative). The logic `maxAmountOut < amountOut` where both are negative (e.g., -1000 < -900) is true, and `amountOut - maxAmountOut` (-900 - (-1000) = 100) correctly calculates the positive excess gain. The finding misinterprets the signed arithmetic as a bug when it is intentional and correct for the V4 system. Regardless of correctness, it is not the target vulnerability."
