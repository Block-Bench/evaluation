An attacker can call `gauge.getReward(address(this))` before the owner's transaction, causing `rewardsBefore` to already include the pending rewards. When the owner's transaction calls `gauge.getReward()`, it returns 0, making `claimed` 0. The rewards are then stuck in the contract because `unlock` only refunds `token0` and `token1`. This is a concrete, profitable exploit (theft of yield) that does not require privileged access."

The function deletes `staked` but fails to call `gauge.withdraw()`. Consequently, `safeTransfer` attempts to transfer `_lp` tokens from an address with zero balance, causing the transaction to revert. This permanently locks the user's funds if they cannot call `unstake` (e.g., due to a paused reward token in `claimRewards`). This is a concrete DoS scenario leading to loss of principal."
