In the context of a gauge system, restricting reward claims to the distribution mechanism or withdrawal is often an intentional design choice (e.g., to enforce compounding or prevent dust). It does not represent a security vulnerability in the sense of funds loss or unauthorized access, as users can still claim via `withdraw`. Therefore, it is a mischaracterization of a design choice."
