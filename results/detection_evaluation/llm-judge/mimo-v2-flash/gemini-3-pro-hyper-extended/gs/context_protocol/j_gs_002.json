The factory's job is to deploy pools; it does not guarantee their usability if dependencies are missing. The 'bricking' of the token pair is a consequence of the user's action, not a security flaw in the factory. The factory owner can still set the gaugeManager later, and any pools created before that will simply remain non-functional, but they do not compromise the security or integrity of the factory or other pools.",
