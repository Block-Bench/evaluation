However, the finding claims it's a critical vulnerability where anyone can drain funds. Looking at the code, there's no actual collateral tracking or validation implemented, but the function signature and documentation suggest it should have it. The finding correctly identifies missing collateral checks but the attack scenario assumes the function works as written when it's actually just incomplete/placeholder code. The real issue is that the function is missing implementation, not that it's actively exploitable in the way described."
