There's no token contract referenced or expected. The 'deposit' is conceptual - users lock tokens elsewhere or this is a staking mechanism. The code doesn't show any token interface or transfer calls, so claiming it's 'missing' is hallucinating an expectation that doesn't exist in this contract's design."

This prevents flash loan attacks because tokens must be held for at least 1 day before voting power is granted. The model failed to recognize this protection.
