  "notes": "The LLM reported 'safe' with 0.85 confidence and provided no findings. This means it completely missed the TARGET vulnerability in withdrawPhantomToken(). The vulnerability exists: withdrawPhantomToken() only checks that a phantom token is registered (phantomTokenToOutputToken[token] != address(0)) but does not verify that the pending redemption's tokenOut matches the expected underlying token. This could lead to token mismatch where the user receives a different token than expected. Since the LLM reported no findings at all, it failed to identify the root cause, location, and type of the TARGET vulnerability.",
