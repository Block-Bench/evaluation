BaseAuth.signatureValidation checks msg.sender for static signatures bound to the entrypoint, causing a revert with InvalidStaticSignatureWrongCaller. This is a valid DOS vulnerability that prevents UserOperations with static signatures from being processed. The LLM failed to detect this issue entirely.",
