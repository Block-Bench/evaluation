While it lacks explicit access control, this is not a critical vulnerability because: 1) It can only be called once, so an attacker cannot repeatedly exploit it after legitimate initialization, 2) The function is part of the upgrade/initialization flow which typically happens immediately after deployment, 3) The attack scenario described (manipulating totalControlled) would require the attacker to front-run the very first call, which is possible but the impact is limited to that single initialization. This is more of a security best practice issue than a critical vulnerability."
