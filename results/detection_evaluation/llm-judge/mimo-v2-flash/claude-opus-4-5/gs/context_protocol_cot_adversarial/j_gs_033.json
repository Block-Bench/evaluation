However, this is not a real vulnerability because: 1) The _salt parameter is the imageHash of the wallet's configuration, which includes the _mainModule. If an attacker changes _mainModule, the imageHash would be different, so they cannot use the same _salt. 2) The wallet address is derived from CREATE2 using the factory address, salt, and creation code. The creation code includes the _mainModule as a constructor argument. So changing _mainModule would result in a different address. The attack scenario described is technically impossible given how CREATE2 and the wallet construction work."
