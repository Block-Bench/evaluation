The getInterestAmount function correctly calculates interest as currentBalance - allocatedBalance. After claiming interest, the position manager's balance decreases by the claimed amount, so subsequent calls would correctly return 0 (or new accrued interest). The interestClaimedFromManager tracking is for accounting purposes but doesn't affect the interest calculation logic.
