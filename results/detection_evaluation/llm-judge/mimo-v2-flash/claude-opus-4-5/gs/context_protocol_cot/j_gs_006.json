However, the ground truth describes a problem in the 'new period' branch (when block.timestamp >= _periodFinish) where rewardRate is calculated using only rewardAmount instead of totalRewardAmount (which includes rollover). The finding's explanation of 'pendingRewards being added to totalRewardAmount which includes rollover' doesn't match the actual code flow - in the existing period branch, pendingRewards represents rewards that would be earned in the remaining time, and adding it to the reserve ensures continuity. The actual bug is in the new period branch where rollover rewards are included in the reserve but excluded from the rate calculation."
