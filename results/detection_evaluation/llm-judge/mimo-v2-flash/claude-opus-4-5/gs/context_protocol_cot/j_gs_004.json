The root cause matches exactly: an attacker can deposit dust, inflate assets via receivePenaltyReward, and cause subsequent deposits to round to 0 shares. The location (deposit function) is correct.

The withdraw function's dependency on the voting state (voted(veTokenId) == false) creates a potential DoS where users cannot withdraw if the operator has voted and cannot reset. This is a valid vulnerability with a concrete attack scenario (operator votes, users blocked) and genuine impact (locked funds).

The function updates 'penalty += amount' AFTER the deposit logic, and if the deposit fails (due to insufficient balance), the transaction reverts entirely due to the external call failure. The penalty variable is never updated in a failed transaction. While the function lacks access control (which is noted in ground truth), the specific accounting corruption described does not occur."
