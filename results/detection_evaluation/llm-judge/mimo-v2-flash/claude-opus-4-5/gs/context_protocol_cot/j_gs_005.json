The model claims poke() doesn't update lastVoted, allowing multiple calls per epoch to inflate weights. However, the actual vulnerability is different: dust votes (1 wei) combined with weight decay cause _poolWeight to round to zero, making poke() revert with 'ZV' due to require(_poolWeight != 0, 'ZV'). The model's attack scenario about extending locks and inflating weights is incorrect - the real issue is that users become unpokable, not that they can manipulate weights multiple times per epoch."
