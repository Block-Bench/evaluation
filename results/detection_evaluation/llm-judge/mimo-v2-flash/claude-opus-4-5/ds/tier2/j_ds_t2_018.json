  "notes": "The LLM incorrectly classified the contract as safe. The contract contains a logic_error vulnerability in the deleteElement function. Using 'delete myArray[index]' on a dynamic array in Solidity does not remove the element - it only sets the value to its default (0) and leaves a gap in the array. This causes data inconsistency where the array length remains unchanged but contains zero values. The ground truth correctly identifies this as a logic_error with the fix being to either swap with the last element and pop, or shift elements. The LLM missed this vulnerability entirely.",
