Additionally, the logic flaw is that it transfers to Owner AND msg.sender, which is likely a bug but not a reentrancy vulnerability. The described attack scenario would not work because transfer() limits gas and the state isn't updated between calls, but the real issue is the double transfer logic, not reentrancy."
