The function checks if creditorAddresses.length > 1500, but an attacker can repeatedly call addCreditors() to grow the array beyond 1500, then cause emptyCreditors() to revert due to the 2300 gas stipend limitation when transferring to msg.sender (though no transfer occurs here, the array deletion of 1500+ elements would exceed gas limits in a transaction). More critically, the function has no access control and the loop-based deletion is gas-intensive.
