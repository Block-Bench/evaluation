However, the code uses uint proportionalAmount = (uint(int256(originalLocked.amount)) * amounts[i]) / totalWeight; which is standard integer division. The amounts array is user-controlled, so users would simply avoid creating splits that result in zero amounts. The code does not burn the original NFT until after validation, and the scenario described (100 * 1 / 1000 = 0) is a user error, not a vulnerability. The original NFT is not burned until after the loop, and the function would revert if any amount is zero due to the require(amounts[i] > 0, 'ZW') check. The actual calculation is: amount = originalLocked.amount * amounts[i] / totalWeight. If this results in 0, the NFT is created with 0 amount, but the original NFT is already burned. This is a potential loss of funds, but it's a user error in parameter selection, not a protocol bug. The amounts array is user-provided, and the user is responsible for ensuring the split amounts are reasonable. The code does not prevent this, but it's not a vulnerability in the protocol logic itself - it's a user error scenario. The finding is hallucinated because it claims a bug where there is only user error potential.",
