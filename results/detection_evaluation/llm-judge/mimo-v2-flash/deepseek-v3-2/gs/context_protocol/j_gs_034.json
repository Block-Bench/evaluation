The ground truth describes a logic error where fees become stranded because claimFees() requires lockedUntil != 0, but unlock() sets lockedUntil = 0 before fees can be claimed. The finding instead claims that _collectFees() incorrectly deducts beneficiary share from claimed amounts before returning them, which would cause the owner to receive less than intended. However, examining the code: _collectFees() does deduct beneficiary share and returns the reduced amounts to _claimFees(), which then transfers those reduced amounts to the recipient. This is actually correct behavior - the beneficiary share is deducted and transferred separately, and the owner receives the remainder. The finding mischaracterizes this as a bug when it's the intended design."
