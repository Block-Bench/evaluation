In the provided code, `receiveETHFromPositionManager` is restricted to `onlyPositionManagerContract`, and position managers are registered by the admin. While a compromised or buggy manager could potentially send ETH, the finding describes a complex, multi-step scenario involving balance manipulation that is not a direct, obvious flaw in the logic of `_allocateETHToManager` itself. The ground truth target is a specific logic error regarding the deactivation of the default manager while auto-allocation is enabled. This finding is distinct and does not match the target. It appears to be a valid observation of a potential accounting inconsistency, but the attack vector requires a trusted component (position manager) to act maliciously or incorrectly, which might be considered out of scope or a different class of issue depending on trust assumptions.
