However, examining the code: when _currentVotingPower is 0 and _newVotingPower is 0, the condition `_newVotingPower == 0 || _newVotingPower < _currentVotingPower` evaluates to `true || false` = `true`, which correctly causes the function to return false (rejecting the vote). The logic is actually correct - zero voting power votes are properly rejected. The finding mischaracterizes correct behavior as a vulnerability."

However, this is the intended design: LockManager acts as a trusted proxy that validates voter permissions internally before calling the plugin's vote() function with LOCK_MANAGER_PERMISSION_ID. The plugin trusts LockManager to properly authenticate voters. The permission check `dao().hasPermission(address(this), _voteCaller, EXECUTE_PROPOSAL_PERMISSION_ID, _msgData())` correctly verifies that the plugin itself (address(this)) has execute permission via the caller (LockManager). This is not a vulnerability but correct access control design for the proxy pattern."
