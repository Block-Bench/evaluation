However, the function correctly converts from token's native decimals to 18 decimals by multiplying amount by WAD (1e18) and dividing by tokenUnit (10^decimals). This is the standard approach: amount * 1e18 / 10^decimals. For USDC (6 decimals): 100e6 * 1e18 / 1e6 = 100e18, which correctly represents 100 USDC in 18-decimal format. The attack scenario described would not occur because the gateway expects amounts in 18-decimal format, and this conversion provides exactly that. The function is working as intended."
