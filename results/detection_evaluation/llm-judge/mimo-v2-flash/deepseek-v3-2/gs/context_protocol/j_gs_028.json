However, the ground truth describes a HIGH severity access_control vulnerability in the recover function. The vulnerability exists when a wallet is behind a checkpointer and a chained signature is used with bit 6 (checkpointer usage flag) set to zero, which causes BaseSig.recover to skip the checkpointer validation block, leaving _checkpointer and snapshot unset. This allows an evicted signer to bypass checkpointer validation using stale wallet configuration. Since the LLM failed to identify this vulnerability entirely, it did not achieve TARGET_MATCH.",
