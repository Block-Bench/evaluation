  "notes": "The LLM reported no findings and classified the contract as safe. However, the ground truth identifies a real input validation vulnerability in the withdrawPhantomToken function. The vulnerability exists because the function only checks if a phantom token is registered (phantomTokenToOutputToken[token] != address(0)) but does not verify that the pending redemption's tokenOut matches the expected underlying token. This could lead to token mismatches where a user receives a different token than expected. Since the LLM did not report any findings, it missed this vulnerability entirely.",
