The function also uses the onlyRole(INTEREST_TOPUP_ROLE) modifier, restricting access to authorized roles. The receiveETHFromPositionManager function that could be called during reentry is payable but contains no logic that could be exploited. The claimed attack scenario would not work because pendingInterest is decreased in _topUpInterestToStakingAndCollectFees, not increased, and the state updates in _claimInterestFromManager happen before the external call, so reentry would see the updated state, not the old state.
