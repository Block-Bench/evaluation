The lock manager is the authorized actor for voting operations, so it's appropriate that it needs the execute permission. The finding describes a scenario where the lock manager has execute permission - which is the intended design, not a bypass. The voter themselves doesn't need execute permission because the lock manager is the authorized voting agent. This is a design choice, not a vulnerability."
