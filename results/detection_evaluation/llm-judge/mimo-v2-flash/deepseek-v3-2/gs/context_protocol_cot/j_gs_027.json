However, this is not a vulnerability - it's an intentional design choice. Users must pass the allowlist to acquire mETH via staking, but once they hold mETH (whether from staking or secondary market), the ability to unstake is expected. The allowlist controls entry (staking), not exit (unstaking). The scenario described (buying mETH on secondary market and unstaking) is legitimate token usage, not a bypass."

However, mETH.mint() is a trusted protocol contract call, not an external untrusted call. The mETH token is controlled by the same protocol and doesn't have hooks that could revert unexpectedly. This is a theoretical concern without a realistic attack scenario. The state update order is acceptable for trusted internal calls."
