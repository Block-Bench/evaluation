The ground truth states that rewardRate is miscalculated by ignoring rollover rewards when block.timestamp >= _periodFinish.

While both relate to reward accounting in notifyRewardAmount, they describe different root causes: ground truth is about missing rollover in rate calculation, finding is about double-counting pending rewards. The finding's scenario (users claiming 50 tokens, then new reward added) would result in actual reserve being 50 + 50 = 100, but the finding claims the function calculates 100 + 50 = 150. However, the code shows rewardRate = (rewardAmount + pendingRewards) / epochTimeRemaining, and syncReward uses totalRewardAmount = rewardAmount + clPool.rollover() for reserve. The finding's description of 'pendingRewards = 0.5 weeks * 100 = 50' and 'new reserve = 50 + 50 = 100' followed by 'gauge thinks reserve is 100 + 50 = 150' is confusing and doesn't accurately reflect the code's logic. The actual issue in the code is that when starting a new period, rewardRate is calculated from rewardAmount only, but totalRewardAmount includes rollover, leading to a mismatch between the rate and the reserve. The finding mischaracterizes this as an inflation issue from pending rewards."
