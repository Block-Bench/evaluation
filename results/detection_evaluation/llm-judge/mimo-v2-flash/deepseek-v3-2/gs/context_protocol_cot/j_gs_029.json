The vulnerability exists because when a session call with BEHAVIOR_REVERT_ON_ERROR fails, the transaction reverts but the nonce is not consumed (the nonce consumption happens before _execute() is called, but the entire transaction reverts, rolling back the nonce consumption). This allows the signature to remain valid for replay attacks where partial call batches can be executed. The LLM completely missed this critical vulnerability.",
