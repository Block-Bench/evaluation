However, this is a misunderstanding of the code's intent. The function is an internal pure function that calculates addresses deterministically - it's not trying to match real DEX pair addresses at all. The actual vulnerability is that the router accepts ANY pair address provided in the path without verifying it comes from a legitimate factory. The finding mischaracterizes the issue by focusing on the address calculation method rather than the missing factory validation. The root cause in ground truth is about accepting unvalidated pairs, not about how addresses are calculated."
