The ground truth emphasizes that after a contract upgrade, acceptedRoot was mistakenly left at 0x00...00, which is the core problem. The finding's attack scenario is valid and demonstrates the same exploit, but frames it as requiring an attacker to call setAcceptedRoot(0), whereas the ground truth describes the state already being at 0 after upgrade.
