However, the state variables _0x8cd0a4 and _0x0cce35 are never updated in this function, so there's no state change between the token pull and ETH transfer that could be exploited. The 'reentrancy' scenario described would fail because the balance check on line 47 uses the token balance, which would be reduced by the transferFrom call.
