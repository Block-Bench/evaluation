      "reasoning": "The finding claims users can arbitrarily inflate voting power without token transfers. However, the deposit function is a legitimate governance mechanism where voting power is granted based on deposits. The code does not show any token transfer requirement, but this is not a vulnerability - it's the expected behavior of a governance system that tracks deposits internally. The finding incorrectly assumes there should be an ERC20 transfer, but the contract design uses an internal accounting system. There is no actual exploit here - users cannot 'arbitrarily' inflate power without following the deposit mechanism as designed."

However, the function has proper security checks: it requires the timelock delay to pass (line 114), requires sufficient votes (66% threshold, line 117), and marks proposals as executed to prevent re-execution. The permissionless nature of emergencyCommit is intentional in decentralized governance - anyone can trigger execution once conditions are met. This is not a vulnerability but a design choice. The finding mischaracterizes standard governance behavior as a security flaw."

The calculation (prop.forVotes * 100) / totalVotingPower is standard Solidity integer division. While rounding down occurs, this is not a security vulnerability - it's a precision limitation. The finding's 'attack scenario' describes preventing legitimate execution, but this is not an attack that benefits an attacker. The rounding behavior is predictable and affects all proposals equally.
