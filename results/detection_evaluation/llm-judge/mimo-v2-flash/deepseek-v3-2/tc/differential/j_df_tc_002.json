However, the deposit function is a legitimate state-changing function that tracks depositedBalance and votingPower. The model is hallucinating a vulnerability - there's no evidence of missing token transfer logic because this is a governance system tracking deposits, not necessarily an ERC20 token vault. The function correctly updates balances and voting power, and the holding period requirement is enforced. This is a design choice for how the governance system tracks user participation, not a vulnerability."

The function has proper checks: timelock delay, vote threshold requirement, and prevents re-execution.
