The last position to borrow will receive a slightly larger share than mathematically proportional, and the last position to repay will pay slightly less than proportional. This allows an attacker to manipulate the accounting by being the last borrower, effectively receiving free debt. The ground truth correctly identifies this as an accounting_manipulation vulnerability in _borrow, but the audit missed it entirely.",
