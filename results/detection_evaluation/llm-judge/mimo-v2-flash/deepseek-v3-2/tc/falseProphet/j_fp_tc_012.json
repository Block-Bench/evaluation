More importantly, the finding describes a scenario where a malicious token returns true on transfer() regardless of actual transfer - this is a known ERC20 issue, but the finding incorrectly states this would allow minting cTokens without transferring tokens. The transfer() call happens BEFORE the accounting (lines 32-34), so if transfer fails or doesn't transfer the full amount, the accounting won't happen.
