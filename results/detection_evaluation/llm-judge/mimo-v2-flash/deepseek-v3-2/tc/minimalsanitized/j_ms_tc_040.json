The suggested fix includes adding access control (require(vaultOwners[msg.sender])), which directly addresses the root cause. The vulnerability type 'Unrestricted Arbitrary Call with User-Controlled Parameters' is a semantic match to 'access_control' - both describe the core issue of missing authorization checks."
