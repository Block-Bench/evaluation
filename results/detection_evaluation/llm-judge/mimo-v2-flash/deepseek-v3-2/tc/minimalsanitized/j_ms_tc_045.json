This matches the ground truth's oracle_manipulation vulnerability where attackers exploited the DebtPreviewer to manipulate perceived collateral value. The attack scenario described (deposit minimal collateral, exploit inflated collateralValue via double multiplication, borrow excessive funds) aligns with the actual $12M exploit. The fix suggestion (remove multiplication by exchangeRate) directly addresses the root cause. The vulnerability type 'Incorrect Health Factor Calculation' is semantically equivalent to oracle_manipulation in this context, as it's about manipulating the oracle/calculator to show false values."
