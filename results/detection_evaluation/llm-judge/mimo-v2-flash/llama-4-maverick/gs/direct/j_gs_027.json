The finding's claimed reentrancy attack requires a malicious unstakeRequestsManager, which is a trusted component in the protocol architecture. The real issue is that the fixed rate doesn't account for subsequent protocol state changes (slashing/rewards), which is fundamentally different from reentrancy."
