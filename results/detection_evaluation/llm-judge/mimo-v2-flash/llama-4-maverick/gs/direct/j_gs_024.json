Reentrancy would only be a concern if the Staking contract had state changes after the external call that could be exploited, but the transfer happens after the request creation. This is more of a trust/permission issue than a reentrancy bug. The code doesn't show any state changes after the transfer that would be vulnerable to reentrancy."
