However, the vote function calls _attemptEarlyExecution which only executes if the proposal can execute and the caller has EXECUTE_PROPOSAL_PERMISSION_ID. The state changes in vote (updating tally and votes) happen before any external call. Even if reentrancy occurred, the proposal would need to pass all execution checks.
