However, the ground truth identifies a critical signature_replay vulnerability in hashCallWithReplayProtection where the wallet address is omitted from the hash, allowing cross-wallet signature replay. The LLM completely missed this vulnerability, resulting in a false negative. The vulnerability exists in the code: hashCallWithReplayProtection does not include address(this) in the hash, which means a signature for Wallet A can be replayed on Wallet B if they share the same configuration and nonce. This is a severe security issue that the LLM failed to detect.",
