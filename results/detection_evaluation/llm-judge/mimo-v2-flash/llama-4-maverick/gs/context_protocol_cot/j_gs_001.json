The withdraw function does have external calls (safeTransferFrom), but it follows Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern correctly by burning shares and updating state before the transfers. The described attack scenario is not feasible because the reentrancy would occur after the critical state changes are complete. This is a mischaracterization of the contract's behavior."
