  "notes": "The LLM output states 'safe' with 0.9 confidence and reports 0 findings. However, the ground truth describes a HIGH severity access_control vulnerability in the recover function. The vulnerability exists when a wallet is behind a checkpointer and a chained signature is used with bit 6 (checkpointer usage flag) set to zero, which causes BaseSig.recover to skip the checkpointer validation block, leaving _checkpointer and snapshot unset. This allows signature validation to pass even when the checkpointer should be enforced. The LLM completely missed this vulnerability.",
