The intended user can still use their wallet regardless of who deployed it. The salt (imageHash) is derived from the wallet configuration, so if an attacker deploys with the same configuration, they are essentially deploying the same wallet. This is not a security issue but rather how CREATE2 works. The finding mischaracterizes normal CREATE2 behavior as a vulnerability."
