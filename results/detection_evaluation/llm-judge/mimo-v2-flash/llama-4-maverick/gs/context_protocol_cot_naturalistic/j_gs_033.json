The salt is derived from the wallet's image hash (configuration), so if an attacker deploys a wallet with the same salt, they would need to use the same mainModule and configuration, effectively creating an identical wallet. The intended user could still use this wallet. The real issue is that the deploy function reverts on collision, which breaks ERC-4337 expectations, but this finding mischaracterizes the problem as a front-running issue rather than the actual DoS issue."
