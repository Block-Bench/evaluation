The clearVote function in LockToVotePlugin has access control (auth(LOCK_MANAGER_PERMISSION_ID)) and checks that the proposal is open and in VoteReplacement mode. More importantly, the actual vulnerability described in ground truth is about flash loan attacks enabling early execution, not reentrancy. The code flow described doesn't match the actual flash loan attack scenario. The unlock function is not the vulnerable point for the target vulnerability."
