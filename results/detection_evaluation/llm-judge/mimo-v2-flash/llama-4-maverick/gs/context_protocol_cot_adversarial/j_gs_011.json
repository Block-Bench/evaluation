The LockManager is the caller, so reentrancy would require the plugin to call back into LockManager's unlock function, which doesn't happen. The voting power is already stored in the plugin, and clearVote only updates the plugin's internal state. There's no state in LockManager being modified after the external call that could be exploited. This is not a reentrancy vulnerability."
