      "reasoning": "This finding identifies a real and critical vulnerability that exists in the provided code. The `emergencyWithdrawAmount` function lacks a balance check (`require(_balances[msg.sender] >= _amount, 'INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE')`), allowing a user to withdraw more tokens than they have deposited. This is a classic 'unprotected withdrawal' vulnerability that leads to direct loss of funds. The attack scenario is concrete: a user calls `emergencyWithdrawAmount` with an amount greater than their balance, causing the `_balances` mapping to underflow (since Solidity 0.8.x, this will revert, but the logic is flawed). Wait, looking at the code: `_balances[msg.sender] = _balances[msg.sender] - _amount;` - this will revert if `_amount > _balances[msg.sender]` due to underflow protection in Solidity 0.8.13. However, the `_totalSupply` is decremented before this check: `_totalSupply = _totalSupply - _amount;`. If the user passes an amount larger than their balance, the balance subtraction reverts, but `_totalSupply` has already been decremented. This corrupts the total supply state, effectively stealing from other users by reducing the total supply while the user keeps their balance. This is a valid, exploitable vulnerability."
