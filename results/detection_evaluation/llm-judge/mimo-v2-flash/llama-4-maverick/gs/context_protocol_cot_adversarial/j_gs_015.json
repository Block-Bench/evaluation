More importantly, the ground truth vulnerability is about createProposal allowing malicious actions to be proposed, not about reentrancy in vote. The code does not show a reentrancy vulnerability here - state is updated before external calls in the vote flow, and the LockManager's proposalEnded is a state update call, not a callback that would allow reentry to vote."
