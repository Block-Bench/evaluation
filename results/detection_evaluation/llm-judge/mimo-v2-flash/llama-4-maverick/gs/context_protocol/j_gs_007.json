The external claimFees function does NOT have the nonReentrant modifier, but the finding's attack scenario relies on a malicious bribe contract reentering claimFees. While the lack of reentrancy protection on the external claimFees is a valid concern, the actual vulnerability in the code is the logic error where _claimFees sweeps the entire token balance (including staking rewards) instead of just fees. The reentrancy concern is secondary and the attack scenario described (draining funds via reentrancy) is not the primary issue - the primary issue is misappropriation of rewards."
