The root cause analysis is partially correct - it identifies that Destructible's owner is uninitialized and C has its own owner, but frames it as an access control issue rather than a shadowing issue. The attack scenario describes a denial-of-service (owner can't destroy) rather than the unauthorized destruction mentioned in ground truth, but the underlying mechanism is the same shadowing problem."
