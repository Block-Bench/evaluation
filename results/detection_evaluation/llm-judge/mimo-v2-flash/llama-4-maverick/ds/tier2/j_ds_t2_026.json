Although there's no explicit reentrancy attack vector here because the contract doesn't call external contracts with Ether before updating state, the use of 'transfer' can cause issues if the owner is a contract that has a fallback function which can potentially fail or be manipulated. Moreover, the contract lacks a selfdestruct function which could be a potential issue if the contract is meant to be upgradable or if there's a need to recover stuck Ether, but its absence isn't a vulnerability by itself.
