This creates a risk of reentrancy or malicious behavior if the called contracts are compromised. The attack scenario described (attacker adding a malicious route and executing it) is concrete and feasible. This is a separate issue from the original target vulnerability (which was about access control on `addRoute`), so it is a valid bonus finding."
