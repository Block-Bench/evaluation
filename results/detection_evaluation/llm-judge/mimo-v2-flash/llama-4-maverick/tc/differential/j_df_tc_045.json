The only external call in `borrow` is `asset.transfer(msg.sender, amount)` (line 131), which occurs AFTER the state update `borrows[msg.sender] += amount` (line 130). This follows the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern. The described attack scenario is impossible because there is no entry point for reentrancy during the execution of `previewMultipleMarkets` or `previewDebt`."
