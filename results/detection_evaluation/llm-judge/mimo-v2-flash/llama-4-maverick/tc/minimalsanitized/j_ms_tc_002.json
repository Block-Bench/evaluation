      "reasoning": "The finding correctly identifies the core vulnerability: flash loans can be used to gain voting power and execute malicious proposals. However, it incorrectly identifies the 'deposit function' as the location. The ground truth specifies 'emergencyCommit' as the vulnerable function. The root cause is correctly understood (instant voting power from deposits with no time-weighting/holding period, combined with immediate execution via emergencyCommit), but the location is wrong. Since root cause is correct but location is wrong, this cannot be TARGET_MATCH. However, the model understood the actual issue, so it's not a complete miss. The classification should reflect that root cause is correct but location is wrong. Wait - re-reading the criteria: 'If EITHER is wrong \u2192 cannot be TARGET_MATCH or PARTIAL_MATCH.' So this should be WRONG_ROOT_CAUSE or similar. But the root cause IS correct in understanding, just the location is wrong. Let me reconsider: The criteria says 'The finding's reported root cause AND reported location must BOTH match ground truth.' Location is wrong (deposit vs emergencyCommit), so this fails the prerequisite. Therefore it cannot be PARTIAL_MATCH. It should be classified as something else. Looking at the categories: WRONG_ROOT_CAUSE doesn't fit because the root cause explanation is actually correct. HALLUCINATED doesn't fit because the issue exists. MISCHARACTERIZED might fit - the code exists but the characterization of which function is vulnerable is wrong. Actually, let me re-read: 'If EITHER is wrong \u2192 cannot be TARGET_MATCH or PARTIAL_MATCH.' So this finding fails the prerequisite. The classification should reflect that it's not a match despite understanding the issue. The closest category would be WRONG_ROOT_CAUSE or MISCHARACTERIZED. But the root cause IS identified correctly in the explanation. The issue is location. Let me check the categories again... I think this should be classified as WRONG_ROOT_CAUSE because while the explanation describes the issue, the finding attributes it to the wrong function (deposit instead of emergencyCommit), which means the root cause as attributed is wrong. The root cause of the vulnerability is in emergencyCommit's immediate execution, not in deposit's design (which is part of the system but the vulnerability manifests in emergencyCommit).",
