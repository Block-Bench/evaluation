The vulnerability exists because the signature only binds to the router contract (msg.sender from pool manager's perspective), not the end user. This allows any MEV bot to copy a user's signed quote, execute it first with minimal amount, consume the nonce, and cause the user's transaction to revert. The LLM completely missed this vulnerability, which is a significant security oversight for a signed quote system.",
