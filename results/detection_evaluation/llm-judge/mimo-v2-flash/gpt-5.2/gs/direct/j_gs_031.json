The ERC-4337 standard requires paymasters or wallets to cover verification gas costs. Depositing funds before validation is standard practice to prevent griefing attacks where an attacker makes the EntryPoint waste computation on invalid signatures. The 'attack' described would require the victim wallet to have ETH and the attacker to submit operations with invalid signatures - but the attacker cannot profit from this, and the deposited funds remain under the wallet's control in the EntryPoint (can be withdrawn). This is not a genuine denial-of-service or fund loss vulnerability, but rather expected behavior. The ground truth target vulnerability is completely different - it's about msg.sender mismatch causing static signature validation to fail."
