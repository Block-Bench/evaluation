  "notes": "The LLM reported 'safe' with 0.9 confidence and provided no findings. This means it completely missed the TARGET vulnerability in withdrawPhantomToken. The vulnerability exists: withdrawPhantomToken only checks that a phantom token is registered (phantomTokenToOutputToken[token] != address(0)) but does not verify that the pending redemption's tokenOut matches the expected underlying. This could lead to receiving a different token than expected if a redemption request was made for a different output token. Since the LLM reported no findings at all, it failed to identify the root cause, location, and type of the TARGET vulnerability.",
