  "notes": "The LLM reported no findings and classified the contract as safe. However, the ground truth identifies a real input validation vulnerability in withdrawPhantomToken(). The vulnerability exists because withdrawPhantomToken() only checks that a phantom token is registered (phantomTokenToOutputToken[token] != address(0)) but does not verify that the pending redemption's tokenOut matches the expected underlying token. This could lead to token mismatches where a user receives USDT when they expected USDC based on the phantom token configuration. Since the LLM did not identify this vulnerability, it failed to meet any of the TARGET_MATCH criteria.",
