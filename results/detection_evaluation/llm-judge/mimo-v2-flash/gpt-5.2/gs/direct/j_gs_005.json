The vulnerability occurs when a user votes with dust (1 wei) on a pool, and after time passes causing vote weight decay, the calculation _poolWeight = _weights[i] * _weight / _totalVoteWeight rounds down to 0, causing the require(_poolWeight != 0, 'ZV') check to revert. This makes the user's votes unpokable, preventing them from updating their voting power to reflect decay, which gives them an unfair advantage in reward distribution. The LLM failed to detect this vulnerability entirely.",
