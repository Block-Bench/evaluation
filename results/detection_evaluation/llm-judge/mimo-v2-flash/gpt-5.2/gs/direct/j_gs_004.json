This leads to incorrect share pricing during deposits when idle HYBR exists, causing dilution of existing holders. This is a valid vulnerability (BONUS_VALID) because it describes a concrete attack scenario where an attacker can profit from existing holders' rewards without requiring privileged access. However, it is classified as PARTIAL_MATCH because it does not match the specific TARGET vulnerability described in the ground truth. The ground truth describes a 'first depositor attack' where an attacker manipulates the share price by donating assets *before* a victim deposits, causing the victim to receive 0 shares. The finding describes a 'dilution attack' where an attacker deposits *while* idle HYBR exists to mint excess shares, diluting future rewards. While both are share price manipulation issues involving `totalAssets` and `deposit`, the specific root cause and attack flow described in the finding (idle HYBR exclusion) differs from the ground truth (donation to inflate asset value relative to shares)."
