The contract contains a critical flash loan vulnerability in the isGranted function of MinVotingPowerCondition. The vulnerability allows attackers to bypass minimum voting power requirements by using flashloaned token balances to create proposals, without needing to lock tokens. The ground truth identifies this as a high-severity flash_loan vulnerability with a clear attack scenario and fix. Since the LLM failed to identify any vulnerability, it cannot achieve TARGET_MATCH or PARTIAL_MATCH status.",
