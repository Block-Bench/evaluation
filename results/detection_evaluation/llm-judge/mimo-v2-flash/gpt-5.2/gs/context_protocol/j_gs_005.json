The vulnerability occurs when a user votes with dust amounts (e.g., 1 wei) on a pool, and after time passes and the veNFT weight decays, recalculating the pool weight using `_weights[i] * _weight / _totalVoteWeight` rounds down to 0, causing the require(_poolWeight != 0, \"ZV\") check to revert. This makes the user's vote unpokable, preventing them from updating their vote weight to reflect decay, which gives them an unfair advantage in reward distribution. The LLM failed to detect this vulnerability entirely.",
