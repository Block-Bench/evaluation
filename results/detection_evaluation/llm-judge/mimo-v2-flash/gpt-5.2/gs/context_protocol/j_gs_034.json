The vulnerability exists in the unlock() function: it deletes lockedUntil before transferring LP tokens, which triggers implicit fee claiming. After lockedUntil=0, the onlyLocked modifier prevents any future claimFees() calls, leaving the newly credited fees stuck. Since the LLM missed this entirely, it failed to identify the target vulnerability.",
