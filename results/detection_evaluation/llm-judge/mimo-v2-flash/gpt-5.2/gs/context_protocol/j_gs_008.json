The root cause is accurate: shares are calculated AFTER the deposit into the veNFT has already occurred, meaning `totalAssets()` includes the newly deposited amount.

The attack scenario is concrete and demonstrates how an attacker can exploit this to steal funds from victims. This is a valid, distinct vulnerability from the TARGET vulnerability (which is in `claimRewards`), meeting all criteria for BONUS_VALID."
