The attack scenario described (front-running large deposits to profit from share price increase) is a valid manifestation of the same underlying issue described in the ground truth (first depositor capturing subsequent deposits via share manipulation). The vulnerability type 'Share mispricing / value extraction' is a semantic match to 'logic_error' as it describes the same logical flaw in share calculation."
