The ground truth suggests the vulnerability relates to supporting tokens with different decimal places. However, the code uses `totalDebt` (set to 10000e6, implying USDC) and a divisor of `365 days * 1e18`. The divisor `31_536_000_000_000_000_000_000_000` is extremely large, which would result in a reward of 0 for any reasonable `_timeDelta` unless `totalDebt` is also astronomically large. This suggests a potential precision loss or logic error where the reward is always zero, or the constants are incorrect. The audit missed this issue entirely.",
