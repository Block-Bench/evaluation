This allows an attacker to manipulate a victim's channel state by using a VC created under a different (attacker-controlled) LC. Additionally, the `numOpenVC--` operation lacks an underflow check, which can permanently lock funds in the victim's channel. The attack scenario is concrete and does not require privileged access."
