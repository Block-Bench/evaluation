While deposit() does grant voting power without token transfer, the ground truth specifies emergencyCommit() as the vulnerable function. The finding also mischaracterizes the root cause - it claims deposit() allows arbitrary amount minting, but the code shows depositedBalance and votingPower are incremented by the passed amount, not set to it. The real issue (per ground truth) is that deposits grant instant voting power with no time-weighting, combined with emergencyCommit() enabling immediate execution. The finding focuses on a different vulnerability (arbitrary amount injection) rather than the flash loan governance attack described in ground truth."
