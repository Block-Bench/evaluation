The function writes campaign state (LN-74) before making an external call to donation.tokenLocker (LN-77), violating the checks-effects-interactions pattern. If the tokenLocker is malicious or compromised, it can reenter and manipulate campaign state via cancelCampaign or other functions. This is a separate issue from the original vulnerability (which was also about reentrancy but the root cause description was 'None' - likely meaning it was a different reentrancy vector or the description was incomplete).
