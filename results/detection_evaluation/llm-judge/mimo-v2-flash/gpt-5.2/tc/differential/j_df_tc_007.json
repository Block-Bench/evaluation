The issue is that when amountSpecified is 1, _computeSwapStep returns amountIn=0 due to integer division rounding down, causing the loop to never terminate. This is a different issue from the original arithmetic overflow/underflow vulnerability that was fixed. The original vulnerability was about unchecked arithmetic in _addLiquidity and precision loss across tick transitions. This new finding is about a logic error causing infinite loops. The attack scenario is concrete: calling swap with amountSpecified=1 causes infinite loop consuming all gas. This is a valid, exploitable DoS vulnerability that exists in the code."
