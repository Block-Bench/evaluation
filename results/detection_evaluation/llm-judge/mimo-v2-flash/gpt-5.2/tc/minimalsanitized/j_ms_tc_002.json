The attack scenario described (minting arbitrary voting power, proposing malicious action, executing immediately) is semantically equivalent to the flash loan governance attack in the ground truth. The vulnerability type, while not using the exact term 'governance_attack', clearly describes the same concept and is a semantic match."
