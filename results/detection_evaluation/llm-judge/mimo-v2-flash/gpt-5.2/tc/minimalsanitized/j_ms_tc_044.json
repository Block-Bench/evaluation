However, the ground truth target is a specific 'donation attack' (oracle manipulation) that relies on the *exchangeRate calculation* logic, not on transfer return values. Furthermore, the code uses Solidity 0.8.0, which reverts on failure, making the 'silent failure' scenario only applicable to non-standard tokens.
