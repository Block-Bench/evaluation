However, the contract contains a critical vulnerability in the mint() function (lines 48-55) that matches the ground truth target. The vulnerability is price_oracle_manipulation: the mint() function accepts any token as collateral without verifying it's a listed market, and uses oracle.getPrice(token) which can be manipulated via flash loans on low-liquidity tokens. The ground truth describes an identical exploit scenario where attackers used flashloans to manipulate token prices, deposited inflated collateral, and borrowed maximum assets. The LLM completely missed this critical vulnerability.",
