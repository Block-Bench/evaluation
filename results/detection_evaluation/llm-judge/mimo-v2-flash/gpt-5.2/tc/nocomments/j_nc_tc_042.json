However, the ground truth target is a specific reentrancy vulnerability in the `registerMarket` function involving a fake Pendle market's `claimRewards` callback. The finding focuses on a different issue (ERC20 compliance) in different functions (deposit/withdraw) and misses the actual critical reentrancy bug entirely.
