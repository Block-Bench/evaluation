In `add_liquidity`, `amounts[1]` is added to `balances[1]` and used in LP minting calculations without pulling funds. In `exchange`, swapping from index 1 to 0 allows an attacker to specify a large `dx` without sending any tokens, yet the contract credits `balances[1]`, debits `balances[0]`, and transfers ETH out. This is a concrete, profitable exploit allowing the attacker to drain all ETH from the pool. The attack scenario is valid and does not require privileged access."
