However, this is incorrect - the receiverAddress parameter is only used locally within flashLoan and doesn't affect the lendingPool.flashLoan call. The actual vulnerability is that executeOperation lacks verification that the flash loan was initiated by the authorized lending pool, allowing malicious contracts to call executeOperation directly and bypass proper flash loan flow."
