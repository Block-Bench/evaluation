The finding's explanation about double-counting locked tokens is technically incorrect - the code adds wallet balance + locked balance, but these are typically separate (locked tokens are usually transferred to the lock manager). The finding correctly identifies that this allows bypassing the minimum threshold, which aligns with the flash loan attack scenario, but the root cause explanation is imprecise."
