This is an intentional design choice to prevent withdrawals during active voting epochs, ensuring the protocol maintains its voting power and reward generation.

More importantly, the function doesn't have any reentrancy-sensitive logic like balance checks before/after that could be exploited. The external call is to a trusted contract (votingEscrow).

The calculation (amount * _totalSupply) / _totalAssets cannot silently overflow - it will revert if overflow occurs, which is safe behavior. Additionally, for this to overflow, the product would need to exceed 2^256-1, which is astronomically large and practically impossible given token supply constraints.
