However, this is not an underflow vulnerability because Solidity 0.8.13 has built-in overflow/underflow protection that would cause a revert, not unexpected behavior. The calculation `veBalance - userAmount - feeAmount` is preceded by `require(veBalance >= userAmount, \"Insufficient veNFT balance\")` and `require(remainingAmount >= 0, \"Cannot withdraw entire veNFT\")`. The latter require would revert if underflow occurred, making this a proper safety check rather than a vulnerability. The code is functioning as intended to prevent over-withdrawal."
