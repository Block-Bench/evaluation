However, getControlledBalance is a view function that only reads data via external calls to getUnderlyingBalance(). It does not modify state, so reentrancy is impossible. The function is also not used in any state-changing operations within the contract. The finding correctly identifies that external calls are made in a loop, but mischaracterizes this as a reentrancy issue rather than a potential gas griefing/DoS issue. However, even the gas griefing concern is limited since this is a view function called voluntarily by external users."
