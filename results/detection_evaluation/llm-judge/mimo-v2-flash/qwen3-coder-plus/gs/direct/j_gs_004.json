It claims the issue is in calculateShares function returning deposit amount when totalSupply is 0, but the actual vulnerability is that calculateShares can return 0 due to rounding down when amount * totalSupply < totalAssets. The finding also incorrectly states that _initializeVeNFT already contains HYBR before the first deposit, which is false - the veNFT is created WITH the first deposit amount. The real issue is that deposit() doesn't require shares > 0, allowing dust attacks where an attacker manipulates the asset ratio to make victim deposits round to 0 shares."
