The finding instead describes signature reuse across different swap amounts, which is not the actual vulnerability present. The digest in the code includes maxAmountIn, maxExchangeRate, and exchangeRateDenom, so a signature for maxAmountIn=1000 cannot be reused for a swap of 500 tokens because the actual swap amount is not part of the digest - but the attack scenario described doesn't match the code's behavior. The real issue is that the sender in the digest is the router address, not the end user, allowing anyone to submit the same signed quote."
