The EG token minting logic calculates: int256 egAmount = maxAmountOut < amountOut ? amountOut - maxAmountOut : int256(0). If exchangeRateDenom is small, maxAmountOut becomes small, which could increase egAmount, but this is bounded by the actual swap amounts. More importantly, the attacker would need to get a valid signature from the quoteSigner with manipulated parameters, which the quoteSigner would not sign.
