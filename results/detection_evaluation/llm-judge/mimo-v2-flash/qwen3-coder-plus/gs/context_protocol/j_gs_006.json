The finding describes an inflation bug, while the ground truth describes a loss-of-funds bug. The finding is technically incorrect about the 'double counting' - adding pendingRewards to the rate calculation is actually correct to maintain the reward rate for the remaining time, and adding it to reserve is also correct. The real issue in the ground truth is that rollover rewards are not included in the rate calculation when starting a new epoch."
