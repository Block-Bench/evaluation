The finding describes an index-skipping bug when removing items from a set during iteration. While both are in the same function, they are distinct vulnerabilities. The finding's described bug (index skipping) does not actually exist in the code - the code uses EnumerableSet which handles removals correctly, and the continue statement with index adjustment prevents skipping.
