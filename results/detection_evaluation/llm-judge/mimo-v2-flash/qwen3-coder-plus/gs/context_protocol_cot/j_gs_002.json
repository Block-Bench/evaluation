The target is specifically about getSwapFee silently discarding fees above 100_000 ppm (10%) and falling back to tick-spacing defaults, which can mislead governance about actual fee rates. The LLM's findings are about getUnstakedFee and getProtocolFee returning 0 for active pools due to gauge-alive checks - different functions, different root causes, different vulnerabilities. Both findings appear to be BONUS_VALID (real vulnerabilities), but the evaluation criteria requires checking if they meet BONUS_VALID criteria. Let me reconsider: Finding 0 and 1 describe real issues with gauge-alive logic causing 0 fees. These are valid vulnerabilities but not the target. Since the task is to evaluate against the TARGET vulnerability, and neither finding matches it, they are classified as WRONG_ROOT_CAUSE because they don't match the target's root cause, even though they identify real issues.",
