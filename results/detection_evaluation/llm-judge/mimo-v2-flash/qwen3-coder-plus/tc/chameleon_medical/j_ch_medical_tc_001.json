The finding incorrectly claims the issue is that attackers can SET the acceptedOrigin, when the real issue is that it's UNINITIALIZED (defaults to zero) and attackers can craft messages that pass validation against the zero value. The function groupAcceptedSource is actually a legitimate setter function that would be used by the owner to initialize the value - it's not the vulnerability itself. The vulnerability is that acceptedOrigin is never initialized to a non-zero value, making the validation at line 40 trivial to bypass."
