Looking at the code, line 50 is: IERC20(_poolCredential).transferFrom(msg.requestor, address(this), _amount); This is indeed problematic but not for the reason stated. The issue is that 'msg.requestor' doesn't exist in Solidity - it should be 'msg.sender'. However, this is a compile-time error, not a runtime DoS. The contract wouldn't even deploy with this error.
