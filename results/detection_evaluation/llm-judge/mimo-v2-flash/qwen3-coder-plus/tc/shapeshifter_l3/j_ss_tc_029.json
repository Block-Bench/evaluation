The parameter _0xb01af6 is passed but never used in any fee calculation or enforcement. The function simply transfers tokens out (line 80), calls the receiver callback (lines 83-90), and then transfers tokens back (lines 93-97). There is no fee collection logic to bypass. The finding is describing a vulnerability that doesn't exist in this code - it's mischaracterizing the absence of a fee mechanism as a bypass of a fee mechanism. The actual vulnerability in Radiant Capital was about arithmetic manipulation through flash loan cycles affecting the liquidityIndex, not about fee bypass."
