The current flashLoan implementation follows standard patterns: it transfers assets, calls the receiver's executeOperation, then transfers back the principal amounts. The absence of explicit premium calculation is a design choice, not a vulnerability. The function correctly validates the callback returns true, and the transferFrom ensures repayment. The finding mischaracterizes normal flash loan mechanics as a vulnerability."
