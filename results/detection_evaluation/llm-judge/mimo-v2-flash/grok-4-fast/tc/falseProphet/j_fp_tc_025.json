There is no mapping for allowances, no approve function, and no allowance check in transferFrom. The function directly subtracts from balances without any permission system. This is not a 'missing access control' vulnerability - it's a fundamental design where transferFrom is callable by anyone without restrictions. The code does not have the standard ERC20 allowance pattern, so there's nothing 'missing' - it's just unpermissioned by design. The attack scenario described is technically possible but mischaracterizes the issue as missing access control rather than recognizing the function is intentionally unrestricted."
