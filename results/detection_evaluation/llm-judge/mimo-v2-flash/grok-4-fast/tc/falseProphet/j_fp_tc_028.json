The root cause matches the ground truth: the bridge's multi-sig system is bypassed because signatures are not actually verified. The model explains that the contract only checks array lengths but performs no cryptographic verification of signatures, allowing anyone to forge authorization. This matches the ground truth description of the Orbit Chain bridge exploit where validators' keys were compromised to forge signatures - the model correctly identifies that the contract fails to verify signatures at all, which is the core vulnerability. The type 'Access Control Bypass / Missing Signature Verification' is a semantic match to 'bridge_security' as both describe the failure of the multi-signature access control mechanism."
