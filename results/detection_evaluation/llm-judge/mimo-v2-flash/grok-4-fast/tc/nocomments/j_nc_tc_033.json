  "notes": "The LLM reported 'safe' with 0 findings, but the contract MigrateTroveZap.openTroveAndMigrate is actually vulnerable to the Prisma Finance exploit. The function accepts a user-controlled 'account' parameter and calls borrowerOperations.openTrove() which can mint debt tokens to that account. Combined with the delegate approval mechanism, an attacker can exploit victims who approved the zap contract to open troves on their behalf and receive the minted tokens. This is a critical access_control vulnerability that the LLM completely missed.",
