This allows a malicious contract to reenter the contract during the callback and call exitMarket() (line 69), which only requires borrowed[msg.sender] == 0. Since borrowed[msg.sender] is incremented AFTER the external call (line 60), the reentrant call sees borrowed[msg.sender] == 0 and successfully exits the market, bypassing the final health check. This leaves the protocol with bad debt.",
