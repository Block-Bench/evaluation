The finding also incorrectly states the proxy uses delegatecall (it does), but then claims initWallet can be called on the proxy to overwrite storage - which is true, but this is a separate issue from the library destruction bug. The ground truth's root cause is about the library having no access control on initWallet and having a kill() function with selfdestruct, allowing anyone to destroy the shared library that all proxies depend on.
