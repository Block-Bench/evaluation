  "notes": "The LLM reported 'safe' with 0 findings, but the contract is actually vulnerable to oracle manipulation. The exchangeRate() function calculates the exchange rate based on totalUnderlying (cash + totalBorrows - totalReserves) divided by totalSupply. An attacker can exploit this by donating tokens directly to the contract address, increasing the 'cash' balance without affecting totalSupply. This inflates the exchange rate, allowing the attacker to mint fewer tokens for the same deposit value, or redeem more tokens for a smaller balance. This is the exact attack vector described in the ground truth (donation attack on low-liquidity market). The LLM failed to detect this critical vulnerability.",
