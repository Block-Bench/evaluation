The code shows _0xb7cc25 is a deposit function that transfers tokens and updates collateral balance. However, the contract lacks any withdrawal mechanism, which is a critical design flaw that results in permanent loss of user funds. While the observation is accurate, the vulnerability type is incorrectly labeled - this is more accurately a 'missing withdrawal functionality' or 'fund lockup' issue rather than a standard 'Locked Funds' vulnerability type. The finding does not match the target vulnerability (price oracle manipulation) which is the actual exploit that occurred in the Blueberry Protocol incident."
