The suggested fix of adding access control would work but doesn't address the underlying logic error. The finding also correctly identifies that the require check does not protect NEW_TUSD, which aligns with the ground truth root cause. Since the location is correct and the root cause is partially identified (the finding explains why NEW_TUSD can be swept), this qualifies as PARTIAL_MATCH rather than TARGET_MATCH due to the type mismatch (Access Control vs logic_error)."
