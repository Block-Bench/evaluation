The described 'attack' scenario involves an attacker depositing collateral and borrowing tokens, which is the intended behavior. The protocol would need to be funded by the deployer, and while the attacker's collateral would be locked, they would also owe repayment. The finding mischaracterizes incomplete functionality as a security vulnerability rather than a missing feature. The actual vulnerability in this code is price oracle manipulation via the SimplifiedOracle's reliance on Curve's get_virtual_price(), which can be manipulated with flash loans."
