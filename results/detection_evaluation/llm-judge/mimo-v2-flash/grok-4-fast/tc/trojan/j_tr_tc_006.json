  "notes": "The LLM reported 'safe' with 0 findings, but the contract is actually vulnerable to price oracle manipulation. The ground truth describes a critical vulnerability where the protocol uses spot prices from AMM pools (Curve) without manipulation resistance. In this code, the borrow() function calls oracle.getUnderlyingPrice(cToken) directly without any TWAP, sanity checks, or flash loan detection. The calculateBorrowPower() function also uses spot prices. This matches the Cream Finance exploit pattern exactly - low-liquidity tokens could have their prices manipulated via flash loans, allowing attackers to inflate collateral values and drain the protocol. The LLM completely missed this critical vulnerability.",
