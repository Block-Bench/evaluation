However, the code includes require statements checking that routes exist and are approved. The audit reported no findings, missing this critical vulnerability. The vulnerability exists because while routes must be approved, the executeRoute function allows arbitrary calldata to be passed to the route contract, which could be exploited if a malicious route is added or if the route contract itself has vulnerabilities that allow arbitrary token transfers from users who approved the gateway.",
