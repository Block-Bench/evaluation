The finding instead describes an internal inconsistency where the first depositor gets inflated shares relative to the oracle price, causing later withdrawals to fail. While the finding correctly identifies that the oracle price affects share calculations, the root cause it describes (inconsistent handling of zero initial deposits) is different from the ground truth's root cause (oracle price manipulation within a single transaction).
