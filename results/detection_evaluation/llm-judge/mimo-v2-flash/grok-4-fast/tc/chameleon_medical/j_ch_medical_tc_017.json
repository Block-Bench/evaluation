The attack scenario describes exploiting this static overvaluation to borrow more than the vault's stablecoin balance, which is a different issue than the flash loan reserve manipulation in the ground truth. While the location (acquireLpCredentialMeasurement) is related to the target function requestAdvance, the root cause (decimal handling vs oracle manipulation) and attack vector (static overvaluation vs flash loan manipulation) do not match the target."

While the location matches (requestAdvance), the root cause described is about lack of default recovery mechanisms, not about LP token value calculation being manipulable via flash loans. The attack scenario involves defaulting on a loan after draining the vault, which is a consequence of missing liquidation, not the core price manipulation issue. The ground truth vulnerability is about how collateral value is calculated (using spot reserves instead of TWAP), enabling overborrowing through temporary price manipulation. This finding is about what happens after borrowing (no way to recover), not about how the borrowing amount is determined."
