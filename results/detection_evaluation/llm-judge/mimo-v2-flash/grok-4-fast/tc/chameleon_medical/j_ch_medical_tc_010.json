During this external call, the attacker can re-enter and call checkoutMarket (line 69-72) to set inMarket[msg.requestor] = false, which bypasses the health check on line 66. This is a classic cross-function reentrancy vulnerability where shared state (inMarket) is modified during reentrancy, causing the final validation to use stale state.",
