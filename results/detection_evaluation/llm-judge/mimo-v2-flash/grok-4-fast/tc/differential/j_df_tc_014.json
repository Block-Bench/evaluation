In the patched code, the swapExactJarForJar function still exists but now includes strict validation: it checks that _targets.length == _data.length, and critically, it requires validTargets[_targets[i]] to be true for each target before calling. This whitelisting approach prevents arbitrary calls. Additionally, the Strategy contract's withdrawAll() and withdraw() functions have proper access control (require(msg.sender == controller)). The model correctly recognized these protections and did not produce any false positives.",
