The contract uses a single mapping `mapping(address => uint256) public deposits` that aggregates balances across all assets without per-asset tracking. This allows an attacker to deposit a low-value, high-decimal token and withdraw a high-value, low-decimal token (like USDC) because the balance check `require(deposits[msg.sender] >= amount)` only verifies the raw unit count, not the asset-specific balance. The attack scenario described is concrete and profitable, requiring no privileged access. This is a separate issue from the original oracle manipulation vulnerability."
