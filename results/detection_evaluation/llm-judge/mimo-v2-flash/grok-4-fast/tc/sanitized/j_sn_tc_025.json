The function signature matches IERC20 but the implementation is incomplete. However, the core issue is that the finding is about a non-existent allowance mechanism - the contract simply doesn't implement ERC20 approvals. This is a design/implementation gap, not a vulnerability in the existing code. The attack scenario describes stealing tokens, but without an allowance system, transferFrom can't work as described - it would revert or behave unexpectedly. The finding hallucinates an allowance system that doesn't exist."
