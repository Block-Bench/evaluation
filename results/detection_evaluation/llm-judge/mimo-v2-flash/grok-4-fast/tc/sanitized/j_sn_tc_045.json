The actual issue is that the borrow function uses a previewer contract that can be manipulated by providing a malicious market address. The finding describes a specific attack vector (excluding current market) but the ground truth identifies the broader issue: oracle manipulation via untrusted market addresses in the previewer call. The location is correct (borrow function calls previewer), but the root cause description focuses on array manipulation rather than the core oracle trust issue."
