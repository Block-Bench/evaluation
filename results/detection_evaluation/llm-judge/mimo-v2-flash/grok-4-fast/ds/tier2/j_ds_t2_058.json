The function has an unbounded loop that iterates through creditorAddresses.length, which can be manipulated by an attacker through addCreditors() to exceed 1500 entries. When emptyCreditors() is called, it will attempt to delete an array of 1500+ addresses, which will exceed the block gas limit and cause the transaction to revert, permanently preventing the win state from being set. This is a classic gas griefing/DoS attack. The LLM missed this vulnerability entirely.",
