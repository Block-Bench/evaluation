The contract's migrate_and_destroy() function uses selfdestruct to send the contract's balance to the owner. However, any contract can force Ether to be sent to this contract via selfdestruct from another contract, which would bypass the consistency check `assert(this.balance == totalSupply)` since the forced Ether would increase this.balance without affecting totalSupply. This would cause the assertion to fail and prevent the migration from completing. The LLM failed to identify this vulnerability.",
