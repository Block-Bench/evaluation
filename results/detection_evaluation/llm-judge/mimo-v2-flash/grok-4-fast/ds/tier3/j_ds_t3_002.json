The root cause explanation matches the ground truth: the contract credits users with the full 'amount' parameter without verifying the actual tokens received, which is exactly what the ground truth describes as 'The actual deposited amount might be lower than the specified depositAmount'. The attack scenario demonstrates this with the STA token's burn mechanism. The suggested fix (checking balance before/after transfer) matches the ground truth fix. The vulnerability type 'Fee-on-transfer token mishandling' is a semantic match to 'token_incompatibility' - both describe the same underlying issue of tokens not behaving as standard ERC20s."
