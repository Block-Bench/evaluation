While the finding's described behavior (loop transfers 2*k after ~2*k iterations) is technically correct for small values, it mischaracterizes the primary vulnerability. The ground truth honeypot is about the overflow trap for large values (>=1 ether) where users expect double but get small amounts due to uint8 overflow. The finding's attack scenario is actually a valid way to drain the contract if it has funds, but this is not the honeypot mechanism described in ground truth. The root cause mismatch is clear: ground truth is about type inference overflow, finding is about unauthorized drainage via small-value calls."
