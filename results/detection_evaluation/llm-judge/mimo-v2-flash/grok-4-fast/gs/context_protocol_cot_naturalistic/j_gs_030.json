The hash function packs uint8(FLAG_IDENTITY_SIGNER) which is 0x04, but the encoding uses firstByte = (FLAG_IDENTITY_SIGNER << 4) = 0x40. This is a discrepancy. However, the ground truth does not mention this issue, and the attack scenario described in the ground truth is about signature replay, not Merkle tree validation failures.
