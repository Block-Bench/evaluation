However, examining the code: in recoverConfiguration, pointerStart is set BEFORE reading blacklistCount (line: `uint256 pointerStart = pointer;`). For small lists (<15), the count is in the lower 4 bits of the flag byte, which was already consumed from the stream before pointerStart is set. For large lists (count == 0x0f), the next 2 bytes are read for the count, advancing pointer. In both cases, encoded[pointerStart:pointer] does NOT include the count encoding. The finding correctly identifies this discrepancy but mischaracterizes it as a vulnerability. The code is intentionally designed this way: the flag byte is separate from the data payload. The hash is computed over the addresses only, which is consistent with how the blacklist is conceptually a set of addresses. The actual vulnerability (signature replay) is unrelated to this hash computation detail."
