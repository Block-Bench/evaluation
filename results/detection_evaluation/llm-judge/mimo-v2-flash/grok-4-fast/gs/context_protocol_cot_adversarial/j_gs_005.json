The ground truth identifies a specific rounding-to-zero issue in the poke function that makes it impossible to update weights. Finding 0 describes a different problem: weights persisting after expiration, which is a general state management issue, not the specific rounding DOS. The attack scenario in ground truth requires dust votes causing _poolWeight to round to 0, while Finding 0's scenario is about not calling poke at all. These are different vulnerabilities."

      "reasoning": "This finding identifies a real, independent vulnerability not in the ground truth. When a gauge is killed, votes persist in weights[pool] and totalWeight until voters manually reset. This causes protocol emissions to be miscalculated and distributed incorrectly to killed gauges. The attack scenario is concrete: governance kills a gauge, lazy voters don't reset, totalWeight stays inflated, active gauges get fewer emissions. This is a genuine loss of protocol efficiency and unfair reward distribution. It doesn't require admin compromise (gauge killing is a legitimate governance function), and the impact is real. This qualifies as BONUS_VALID."

The impact is minimal - users can still only vote on 30 pools initially, and the poke just maintains existing votes. This is more of a design consideration than a security vulnerability."
