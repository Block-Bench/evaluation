While the vulnerability enables flashloan attacks, the core issue is the logic error in using balance instead of locked balance. The attack scenario described is valid but focuses on spam creation rather than the flashloan attack vector mentioned in ground truth. Since root cause and location match, but type is only semantically related (not exact/semantic match to 'flash_loan'), this is PARTIAL_MATCH."
