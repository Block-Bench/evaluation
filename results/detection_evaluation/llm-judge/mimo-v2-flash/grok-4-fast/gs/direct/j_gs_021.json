The vulnerability exists because the signature only binds to the router contract (msg.sender), not the original end-user caller. This allows MEV bots to copy signed quotes from the mempool and execute them first with minimal amounts, consuming the nonce and causing the legitimate user's transaction to revert. The LLM completely missed this critical vulnerability.",
