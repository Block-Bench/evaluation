  "notes": "The LLM reported 'safe' with 0 findings, but the contract contains a real DOS vulnerability in the poke() function. The ground truth describes a specific attack where dust votes (1 wei) combined with voting power decay cause _poolWeight to round down to zero, triggering the require(_poolWeight != 0, 'ZV') check and preventing the poke() from updating the user's vote weights. This allows attackers to maintain inflated voting rewards while their voting power decays. The LLM completely missed this vulnerability.",
