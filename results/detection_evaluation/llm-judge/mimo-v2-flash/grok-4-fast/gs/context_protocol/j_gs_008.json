If the current lock end is already far in the future (e.g., 4 years), `maxUnlockTime` (current time + 4 years) will likely be less than `locked.end + 2 hours`, so the extension is skipped. The logic preserves long locks, contrary to the finding."

This leads to incorrect share calculations: deposits under-mint shares (diluting depositors), and withdrawals leave loose assets behind (losing value for remaining users). The attack scenario is concrete: operator claims rewards, creating loose HYBR; subsequent deposits/withdrawals are mispriced. This is a real, exploitable logic flaw."

If `multiSplit` reverts on zero amounts or returns an invalid token ID, the transaction fails. If it succeeds, `veTokenId` is set to an invalid/zero-value NFT, causing future `deposit_for` calls to fail.
