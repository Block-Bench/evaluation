  "notes": "The LLM output incorrectly classified the contract as 'safe' with 0 findings. However, the contract contains a real, exploitable vulnerability in the emergencyWithdraw() function. The vulnerability exists because emergencyWithdraw() lacks the updateReward() modifier, which means users who call it will permanently lose all accrued but unclaimed rewards. The earned rewards remain stuck in the contract forever. This is a legitimate logic error with a concrete attack scenario that results in loss of funds for users. The LLM completely missed this vulnerability.",
