It then passes `HybraTimeLibrary.MAX_LOCK_DURATION` to the function. This is indeed a mismatch if the interface expects an absolute time, but the finding claims the fix is to pass `maxUnlockTime`. The code already calculates `maxUnlockTime` but doesn't use it in the call. However, the vulnerability description focuses on the parameter mismatch. The code does pass a relative duration where an absolute might be expected, but the finding is about the *parameter type* mismatch. The code is `IVotingEscrow(votingEscrow).increase_unlock_time(veTokenId, HybraTimeLibrary.MAX_LOCK_DURATION);`. The finding suggests passing `maxUnlockTime`. This is a valid observation of a likely bug, but the classification depends on whether this is a 'vulnerability' or just a bug. Given the context of 'loss of rewards', it is a functional bug.
