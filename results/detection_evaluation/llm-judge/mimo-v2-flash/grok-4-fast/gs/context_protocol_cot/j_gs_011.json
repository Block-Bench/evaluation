However, the contract contains a HIGH severity flash loan vulnerability in the vote() function when EarlyExecution voting mode is enabled. The vulnerability allows an attacker to flashloan tokens, lock them, vote YES to trigger early execution, unlock tokens, and repay the flashloan - all in one transaction. This is a real, exploitable vulnerability that the LLM completely missed.",
