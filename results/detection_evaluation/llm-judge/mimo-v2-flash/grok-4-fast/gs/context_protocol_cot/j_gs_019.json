The ground truth states the vulnerability is that withdrawPhantomToken 'does not verify that the pending redemption's tokenOut matches the expected underlying' - the finding's explanation that the withdraw call lacks a tokenOut parameter is the technical manifestation of this root cause. The attack scenario in the finding matches the ground truth scenario where a mismatch between configured phantom token and actual redemption output occurs.
