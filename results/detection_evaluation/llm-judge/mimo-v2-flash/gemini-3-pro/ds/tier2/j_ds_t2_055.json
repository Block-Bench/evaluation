If `N` is older than 256 blocks, `blockhash(N)` returns `bytes32(0)`. The contract allows users to guess the hash of a future block but does not enforce a time limit on when `settle()` can be called. An attacker can exploit this by guessing `bytes32(0)` and waiting until the target block is outside the 256-block window.",
