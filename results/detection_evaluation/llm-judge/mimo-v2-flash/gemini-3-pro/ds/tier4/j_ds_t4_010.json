The attack scenario follows the exact pattern described in the ground truth: interacting with the pool triggers a callback to the operator, which then calls `getReward` on the target contract while the pool is in the vulnerable state. The type 'Read-Only Reentrancy' is a semantic match for 'reentrancy'."
