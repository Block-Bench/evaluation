However, the receive() function is a security measure to prevent accidental ETH deposits. The protocol is designed to work with Position Managers that implement specific interfaces (IPositionManager). If a manager returns ETH via a standard call, it indicates a misconfiguration or incorrect manager implementation, not a vulnerability in LiquidityBuffer. The contract provides a dedicated `receiveETHFromPositionManager` function for managers to call. This finding describes a configuration/integration issue rather than a core logic vulnerability."
