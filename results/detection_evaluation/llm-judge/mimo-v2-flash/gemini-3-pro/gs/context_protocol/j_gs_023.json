However, the code shows that Position Managers are expected to implement a withdraw() function. The standard pattern in the code is for the manager to withdraw and then the buffer sends to staking. The receive() function reverting is a safety mechanism to prevent accidental ETH sends. The actual vulnerability described in ground truth is about getControlledBalance() under-reporting and funds being locked due to deactivation, not about the receive() function. This finding identifies a potential integration issue but not the specific logic error in the target vulnerability."
