The `calculateShares` function is the core logic used by `deposit`.\n2. **Root Cause Match**: The finding explicitly describes the 'First Depositor Inflation Attack' where an attacker donates assets to inflate `totalAssets` while `totalSupply` remains low, causing subsequent deposits to round down to 0 shares. This matches the ground truth root cause: 'deposit does not ensure that we mint at least one gHYBR share' and 'Alice donates 1000e18 assets... Bob deposits... rounds down to 0'.\n3. **Type Match**: 'Economic Exploit' is a semantic match for 'logic_error' in this context, as it describes a flaw in the economic/logic design of the share minting mechanism."
