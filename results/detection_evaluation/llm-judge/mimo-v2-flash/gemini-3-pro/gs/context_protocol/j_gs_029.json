However, the ground truth identifies a HIGH severity signature_replay vulnerability in the execute() function. The vulnerability exists because when a session call with BEHAVIOR_REVERT_ON_ERROR fails, the transaction reverts but the nonce is not consumed (the nonce consumption happens before _execute() is called, but if _execute() reverts, the entire transaction reverts including the nonce consumption). This allows the same signature to be replayed for partial calls. The LLM completely missed this critical vulnerability.",
