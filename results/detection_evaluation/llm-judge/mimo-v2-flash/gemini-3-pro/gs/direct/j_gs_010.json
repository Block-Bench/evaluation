The attack scenario described is accurate and demonstrates the real-world exploit. However, the vulnerability type 'Double Counting' is imprecise. The issue is not about double counting locked tokens, but about using a flash-loanable balance for governance gating. The ground truth type is 'flash_loan', which is more accurate. Since root cause and location are correct but type is imprecise, this is a PARTIAL_MATCH."
