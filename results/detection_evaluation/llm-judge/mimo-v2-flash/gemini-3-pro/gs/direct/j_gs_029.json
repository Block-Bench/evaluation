  "notes": "The LLM incorrectly marked the contract as safe with 0.95 confidence, reporting 0 findings. However, the contract contains a HIGH severity signature replay vulnerability in the execute() function. The vulnerability occurs when a session call with BEHAVIOR_REVERT_ON_ERROR fails - the transaction reverts but the nonce is not consumed, allowing the signature to be replayed for partial calls. Session signatures are validated per-call using individual call hashes, enabling partial replay attacks where frontrunners can execute subsets of calls to grief or cause financial loss. This is a critical vulnerability that the LLM completely missed.",
