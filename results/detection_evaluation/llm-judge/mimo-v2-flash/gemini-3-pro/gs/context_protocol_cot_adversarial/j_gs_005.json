This is a valid DOS vulnerability with a concrete attack scenario (admin updates gauge manager -> user cannot reset/vote/poke) and a valid fix (store bribe addresses). It is not the target vulnerability (which is about dust votes causing zero weight rounding in `_vote`), but it is a legitimate bug."
