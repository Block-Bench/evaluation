However, the `GrowthHYBR` contract does not use a standard ERC4626 share calculation where `totalAssets` is derived from the contract's token balance. Instead, `totalAssets()` calls `IVotingEscrow(votingEscrow).locked(veTokenId)`. This returns the amount locked in the veNFT, which is not easily manipulated by external donations in standard ve implementations. Furthermore, the `deposit` function calls `_extendLockToMax()` after adding funds, which would likely fail or behave unexpectedly if the veNFT balance was artificially inflated. The attack scenario described relies on manipulating `totalAssets` via `deposit_for`, but this does not align with how `totalAssets` is retrieved in this specific contract."
