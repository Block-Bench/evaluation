BaseAuth.signatureValidation enforces caller binding, causing revert for static signatures bound to entrypoint.' Finding 0, however, attributes the revert to 'InvalidSignatureWeight' or 'InvalidStaticSignatureExpired' checks in BaseAuth, claiming these violate ERC-4337's requirement not to revert. While the self-call mechanism is indeed present, the specific failure mode described in the ground truth (caller mismatch due to msg.sender change) is not the focus of Finding 0. Instead, Finding 0 focuses on a generic compliance violation regarding error handling, missing the specific binding issue."
