The ground truth identifies `getControlledBalance` as the function where the symptom (under-reporting) occurs, but explicitly states the root cause is that withdrawals are blocked in `_withdrawETHFromManager` (and `onlyPositionManagerContract`). Since the finding identifies the specific function that enforces the blocking logic, it matches the location requirement.\n\n3. **Type Match**: The claimed type is \"Denial of Service / Fund Lockup\".
