However, in Uniswap V4, the delta returned by afterSwap is a transfer delta from the hook to the user (positive means hook pays user). The code calculates egAmount as the excess gain (amountOut - maxAmountOut) and returns it. If the user receives more than expected, the hook receives the excess. The logic is actually correct: the hook mints the excess to itself and returns that amount, which transfers the excess from the pool to the hook. The finding misinterprets the V4 delta system."
