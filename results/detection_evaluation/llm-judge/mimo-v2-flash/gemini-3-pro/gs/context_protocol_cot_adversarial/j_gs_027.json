However, the ground truth target vulnerability is about the **timing of rate fixation** in `_unstakeRequest` (slashing/risk socialization) and **reward dilution** (locked mETH continuing to earn rewards). The finding focuses on a different accounting mechanism (internal buffer transfers affecting the rate) rather than the specific risk fixation and reward allocation issues described in the ground truth. Therefore, it does not match the target vulnerability."
