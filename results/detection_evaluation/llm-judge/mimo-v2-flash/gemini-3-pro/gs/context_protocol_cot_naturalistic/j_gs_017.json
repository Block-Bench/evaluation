If voting power decreases (e.g., due to token decay or slashing), this underflows and reverts. The attack scenario is concrete: user votes with 100 power, power drops to 80, update reverts, user retains 100 voting power despite only having 80 tokens. This is a real economic exploit that allows users to maintain inflated voting power. The fix is valid: handle both increases and decreases in voting power."
