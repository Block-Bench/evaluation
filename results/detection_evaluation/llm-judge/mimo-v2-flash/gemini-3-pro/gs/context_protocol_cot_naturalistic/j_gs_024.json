The attack scenario matches the ground truth exactly. Although the type is labeled 'Denial of Service / Griefing' rather than 'front_running', it describes the same concept (front-running to cause a DoS), which constitutes a semantic match."

The finding describes a scenario where cumulativeDrawdown exceeds available balances, causing a revert. While this would cause a revert, it is not a vulnerability that leads to loss of funds or unauthorized access; it is a potential logic error that would halt protocol operations. The code does not contain an actual exploitable vulnerability here, as the arithmetic is protected and the scenario described is a potential operational issue rather than a security flaw."
