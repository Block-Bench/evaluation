Events in Solidity don't require copying data to memory - they log it directly. The return data is already in memory from the call operation, and event emission just logs a reference. Even if it were true, the attack scenario requires a malicious contract that the user chooses to call, which is outside the protocol's control. This is a design consideration, not a security vulnerability."

The fix suggested is correct, but the issue doesn't lead to loss of funds or unauthorized access. It's informational/optimization rather than a security flaw."
