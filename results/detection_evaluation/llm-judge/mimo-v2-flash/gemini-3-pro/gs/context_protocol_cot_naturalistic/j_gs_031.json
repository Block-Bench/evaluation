The finding confuses the behavior of `validateUserOp` (which can revert) with the requirement for `isValidSignature` (ERC-1271) to return a magic value. Since `validateUserOp` is not required to return a specific value for invalid signatures (it can revert), this is not a compliance violation or DoS vulnerability."

The attack scenario describes exactly how valid signatures are rejected due to the `msg.sender` mismatch.
