However, this is not a critical vulnerability because: 1) The loop only runs when a position manager sends ETH back to the buffer, which is a trusted actor (controlled by admin). 2) The gas cost is linear and predictable; with a reasonable number of managers (e.g., <100), the gas cost is negligible. 3) There is no profitable attack scenario for an external attacker. It is a gas optimization concern, not a security vulnerability."
