If all weights are zero, `_totalVoteWeight` remains 0. The subsequent loop `for (uint256 i = 0; i < _poolCnt; i++)` iterates, but the calculation `uint256 _poolWeight = _weights[i] * _weight / _totalVoteWeight;` is only reached if the gauge is alive. If the gauge is alive and `_totalVoteWeight` is 0, this would indeed revert. However, the ground truth identifies a specific rounding error vulnerability in `poke` where small weights become zero. This finding identifies a different input validation issue (all zeros). While technically a bug, it is distinct from the target vulnerability."
