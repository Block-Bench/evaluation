However, the root cause described in the finding (Gateway tracks pending amounts per token, withdraw call is ambiguous) differs from the ground truth root cause (withdrawPhantomToken doesn't verify pending redemption's tokenOut matches expected underlying). The ground truth vulnerability is about a mismatch between the phantom token's tracked token and the actual pending redemption, while this finding is about the withdraw function not specifying which token to withdraw at all. These are related but distinct issues. The finding correctly identifies that the adapter doesn't pass tokenOut to the Gateway's withdraw function, which is a valid concern, but it's not the specific input validation vulnerability described in the ground truth."
