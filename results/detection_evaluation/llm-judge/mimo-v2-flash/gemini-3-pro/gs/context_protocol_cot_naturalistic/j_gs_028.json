  "notes": "The LLM output states 'safe' with 0.95 confidence and reports 0 findings. However, the ground truth describes a HIGH severity access_control vulnerability in the recover function. The vulnerability exists when a wallet is behind a checkpointer and a chained signature is used with bit 6 (checkpointer usage flag) set to zero, which causes BaseSig.recover to skip the checkpointer validation block, leaving _checkpointer and snapshot unset. This allows an evicted signer to bypass checkpointer validation using stale wallet configuration. Since the LLM failed to identify this vulnerability entirely, it is a false negative. The target_assessment shows complete_found=false and partial_found=false because no finding was reported.",
