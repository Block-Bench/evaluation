The vulnerability occurs because when a session call with BEHAVIOR_REVERT_ON_ERROR fails, the transaction reverts but the nonce is not consumed (consumed before execution in _consumeNonce). Session signatures validated per-call using individual call hashes enable partial replay attacks. Frontrunners can execute subsets of calls to cause financial loss. This is a critical finding that was completely missed.",
