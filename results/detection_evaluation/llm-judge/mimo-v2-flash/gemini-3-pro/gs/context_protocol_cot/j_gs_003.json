The finding instead describes a different issue: that the global `rewardPerTokenStored` is not updated, causing an artificial inflation of the reward rate for remaining stakers after the withdrawal. While related to the lack of `updateReward`, the described impact (stealing rewards from other users via inflation) is different from the ground truth impact (loss of user's own uncheckpointed rewards + tokens stuck).
