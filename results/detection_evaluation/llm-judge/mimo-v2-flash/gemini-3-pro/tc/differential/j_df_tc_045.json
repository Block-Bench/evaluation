Since `ExactlyMarket.borrow` (line 122) passes a user-controlled `markets` array directly to this function, an attacker can pass duplicate market addresses to artificially inflate their collateral value. This allows borrowing more than the actual collateral supports, leading to insolvency. The attack scenario described is concrete and profitable."
