The check on line 22 `(v != 0 || r != bytes32(0) || s != bytes32(0))` evaluates to false, skipping the permit call. The function then proceeds to `_bridgeOut` which would use `transferFrom` based on existing allowances. This allows an attacker to drain any account that has approved the BridgeRouter contract.
