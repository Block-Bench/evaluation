While `transfer` does limit gas, the function performs all state updates (balance deduction, supply updates) *before* the external call. If the transfer fails (reverts), the entire transaction reverts, restoring the state. The user does not lose funds or get locked out; they simply cannot complete the withdrawal at that moment. This is a potential UX issue or incompatibility with certain smart wallets, but it does not constitute a high-severity vulnerability where funds are permanently lost or the system is broken.
