This is effectively a linear invariant matching the pool's total value. The `exchange` function uses `dy = (dx * balances[uj]) / (balances[ui] + dx)`, which is a constant sum invariant (x+y=k), not constant product (xy=k). While the invariants are different (linear vs constant sum), the specific attack scenario described (arbitrage) is inherent to the pool design rather than a bug in the implementation."
