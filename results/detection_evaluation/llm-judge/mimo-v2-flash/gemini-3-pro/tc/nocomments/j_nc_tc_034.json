The contract has a critical flaw where the deposit function uses oracle.getAssetPrice(msg.sender) to price collateral, but msg.sender is the depositor's address, not the asset being deposited. This allows oracle manipulation attacks as described in the ground truth. However, since no findings were reported, the model failed to detect this vulnerability.",
