Even if it did, the attack scenario requires a non-standard token that returns false instead of reverting. This is a theoretical issue with non-standard tokens, not a concrete vulnerability in the provided code. The real issue in claimResources is the lack of slippage protection and the 1:1 exchange rate, but this finding mischaracterizes the actual problem."
