However, the code provided is obfuscated and likely a test case or a specific implementation where this behavior is intentional or the inputs are constrained. The loop logic `if (_0x2ff8d2 > 0) { _0x2ff8d2 -= int256(_0x876f47); } else { _0x2ff8d2 += int256(_0xb7cc25); }` is complex. If `_0x876f47` is 0, the subtraction doesn't happen. However, the ground truth target is a specific arithmetic error in liquidity tracking (overflow/underflow), not a generic infinite loop DoS. The finding is technically correct about the loop behavior for input 1, but it is not the target vulnerability described in the ground truth."
