However, the function _0x6ff151 is called by QuantumBridge (line 27), and the 'from' address (_0x1045d1) is passed from the deposit function. The finding suggests an attacker could call this directly with a victim's address, but this would require the victim to have approved BridgeHandler, which is a standard ERC20 approval risk, not a specific vulnerability in this contract. The function is designed to be called by the bridge, and the direct-call scenario is a mischaracterization of the actual risk."
