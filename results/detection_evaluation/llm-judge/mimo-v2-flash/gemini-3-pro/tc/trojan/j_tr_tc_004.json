The logic for `amounts[1]` (Token 1) is likely intended for a future token integration or is simply unimplemented. The finding describes a scenario where an attacker mints LP tokens for free to steal ETH, but `remove_liquidity` calculates withdrawal amounts based on `balances[0]` and `balances[1]`. If `amounts[1]` is added without a real token transfer, `balances[1]` increases, which dilutes the attacker's share of `balances[0]` (ETH) in the removal calculation `(lpAmount * balances[0]) / totalLPSupply`. The attacker would not gain an advantage; they would simply own a share of a pool they didn't contribute to, but their share of the ETH would be diluted by the fake Token 1 volume.
