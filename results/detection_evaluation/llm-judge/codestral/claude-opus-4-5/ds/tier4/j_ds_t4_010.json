This means `get_virtual_price()` returns a manipulated (inflated) value during the callback. The OperatorContract's `performReadOnlyCallback()` demonstrates this attack pattern - it adds liquidity, then removes it, and during the ETH transfer callback in `receive()`, it calls `target.getReward()` which reads the manipulated virtual price. While `getReward()` is currently a view function, the comment indicates reward transfer logic is omitted. In a complete implementation, this would allow attackers to claim inflated rewards.",
